 that covers that target. The number of covers is arrived at by combination. For each target, there is some subset of sensors that covers that target. These subsets obviously have some cardinality. So if, for all sensors, we find the product of the sensor cardinality, we know the number of covers. Formally, \begin{equation}
\text{Number of covers } = \prod_{i = 1}^{|T|} |t_i
\end{equation}
