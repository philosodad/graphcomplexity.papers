\begin{thm}
  Algorithm~\ref{alg:dhgmm} produces a 2-approximate edge cover.
  \label{thm:dhgmm}
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}{Proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:dhgmm}}
  \begin{dfn}
    \begin{description}
    \item[$G$] A hypergraph $G(V,E)$ with vertexes $v \in V$ and edges $e\{u,v,...,z\} \in E$
    \item[\cCd] The optimal edge cover of $G$
    \item[\cBd] The cover generated by Algorithm~\ref{alg:dhgmm}
    \item[\bId] $v \in \cB \land v\in \cC$
    \item[\bOd] $v \in \cB \land v\notin \cC$
    \item[$\omega_u$] The weight of u
    \item[$\varpi_v$] The incident weight of v
    \item[$ u \sigma v $] u is incident to v in $G$
    \end{description}
  \end{dfn}
  \begin{prop}
    $\omega_{\bI} \le \omega_{\cC} \land \omega_{\bO} \le \omega_{\cC} \implies \omega_{\cB} \le 2(\omega_{\cC})$, which is what must be shown.
    \label{prp:weightcomp}
  \end{prop}

  \begin{lem}
    $\omega_{\bI} \le \omega_{\cC}$
    \label{lem:IleC}
  \end{lem}
  \begin{proof}{Proof of Lemma~\ref{lem:IleC}}
    This is obvious, as no vertex can be counted twice, and every vertex that is in \bId\ is also in \cCd.
  \end{proof}
  \begin{lem}
    $\omega_{\bO} \le \omega_{\cC}$
    \label{lem:OleC}
  \end{lem}
  \begin{lem}
    $\forall u \in C$, $\sum_{\omega_v} (v \in \bO\text{, }v \sigma u) \le \omega_u$
    \label{lem:incidentweight}
  \end{lem}
  \begin{proof}{Proof of Lemma~\ref{lem:OleC},~\ref{lem:incidentweight}}
    \begin{equation}
      v \in \bO \land v \notin \cC \implies v \sigma u \in \cC
    \end{equation}
    Assume Lemma~\ref{lem:incidentweight} is false. In this case, $\varpi_u \le 0$. However, in order for this to happen, a vertex $v\sigma u$ would have been chosen by Algorithm~\ref{alg:dhgmm} when it was both being compared to $u$ and $\varpi_v > \varpi_u$. This contradicts the basic function of the algorithm, Lemma~\ref{lem:incidentweight} is true.
    Lemma~\ref{lem:incidentweight} implies $\omega_{\bO} \le \omega_{\cC}$, so Lemma~\ref{lem:OleC} is true as well.
  \end{proof}
        
  Therefore, the conditions of proposition~\ref{prp:weightcomp} are satisfied, and Thereom~\ref{thm:dhgmm} is true.
\end{proof}
