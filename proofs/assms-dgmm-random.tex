\begin{assm}
Weights and degrees are distributed randomly through the graph.
\end{assm}
\begin{assm}
For a node $u$ with maximum degree $\Delta$ the average degree of all neighbors of $u$ is $\approx \sfrac{\Delta}{2}$.
\end{assm}
\begin{assm}
For a node $u$ with maximum weight $W$, the average weight of all neighbors of $u$ is $\approx \sfrac{W}{2}$.
\end{assm}
\begin{assm}
If two nodes $u,v$ form the endpoints of an edge in the a matching for a round, we can assume that each is equally likely to join the cover without loss of generality.
\end{assm}
