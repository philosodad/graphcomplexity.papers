\begin{assm}
\label{assm:distribution}
Weights and degrees are distributed randomly through the graph.
\end{assm}
\begin{assm}
\label{assm:likelihood}
If two nodes $u,v$ form the endpoints of an edge in the a matching for a round, we can assume that each is equally likely to join the cover without loss of generality.
