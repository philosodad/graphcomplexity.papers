\begin{ldef}
The active degree of a node $u$ is the number of unweighted edges of $u$ indicated by $\alpha(u)$. $\alpha(u)$ is either 0 for committed nodes or equal to the number of active neighbors of $u$ for active nodes.
\end{ldef}
\begin{ldef}
$\delta$ is the largest active degree in the graph.
\end{ldef}
\begin{ldef}
If $\alpha(u) = \delta$, each neighbor of $u$ has an active degree of $\gamma \le \delta$. Formally, for a graph G(V,E) $\forall u,v \in V \suchthat e(u,v) \in E, \alpha(u) = \delta \implies \alpha (v) = \gamma$.
\end{ldef}
