	Abstract = {This paper describes a greedy {\ensuremath{\Delta}}-approximation algorithm for monotone covering, a generalization of many fundamental NP-hard covering problems. The approximation ratio {\ensuremath{\Delta}} is the maximum number of variables on which any constraint depends. (For example, for vertex cover, {\ensuremath{\Delta}} is 2.) The algorithm unifies, generalizes, and improves many previous algorithms for fundamental covering problems such as vertex cover, set cover, facilities location, and integer and mixed-integer covering linear programs with upper bound on the variables.

The algorithm is also the first {\ensuremath{\Delta}}-competitive algorithm for online monotone covering, which generalizes online versions of the above-mentioned covering problems as well as many fundamental online paging and caching problems. As such it also generalizes many classical online algorithms, including lru, fifo, fwf, balance, greedy-dual, greedy-dual size (a.k.a. landlord), and algorithms for connection caching, where {\ensuremath{\Delta}} is the cache size. It also gives new {\ensuremath{\Delta}}-competitive algorithms for upgradable variants of these problems, which model choosing the caching strategy and an appropriate hardware configuration (cache size, CPU, bus, network, etc.).},

	Abstract = { Energy consumption in monitoring and communication protocols for wireless sensor networks became one of the most important performance objective.We assume a commonly accepted sensor network model in which sensors can interchange idle and active modes both for monitoring and communicating. We introduce a reliability requirement for distributed target-monitoring protocols and prove that previously considered protocols [1],[2] are reliable. In this paper we propose a new Deterministic Energy- Efficient Protocol for Sensor networks (DEEPS) aimed at prolonging the lifetime. We prove that DEEPS is reliable and compare DEEPS with several known target-monitoring protocols in NS2 environment using LEACH[4] protocol for data delivery to the base. We implemented the full-fledged simulation of the monitoring protocols on NS2 combined with LEACH[4] as a communication protocol, and performed extensive experimental study of several protocols showing almost 2 times increase in the lifetime for DEEPS over known protocols. },

	Abstract = {The genome projects have provided comprehensive information about the basic building blocks of life. The next challenge is to understand how biological functions emerge from complex interactions of these building blocks. In this work, we present a generic, extensible in silico simulation framework which allows the experimenter to lest various hypotheses of an experiment 'in silico' and develop a model for subsequent wet test analysis. Undertaking a systems approach, we abstract a biological process as a set of interacting functions driven in time by a set of discrete events. We focus on three two-component gene regulatory networks, (a) PhoP/PhoQ network (b) barA/sirA network and (c) pmrB/pmrA network involved in bacterial pathogenesis in Salmonella Typhimurium and capture their interactions in various stages of infection. We report results on the expression of various gene and gene products from these pathways. We conclude that such a stochastic framework can provide insight into how collective interaction of different molecules manifests in physiology and diseases.},

Specific results include the following.

For WEIGHTED VERTEX COVER, the first distributed 2-approximation algorithm taking O(log n) rounds and the first parallel 2-approximation algorithm in RNC. The algorithms generalize to covering mixed integer linear programs (CMIP) with two variables per constraint (δ = 2).

For any covering problem with monotone constraints and submodular cost, a distributed δ-approximation algorithm taking O(log2 |C|) rounds, where |C| is the number of constraints. (Special cases include CMIP, facility location, and probabilistic (two-stage) variants of these problems.)},

	Abstract = {For decades we have been using Chomsky's generative system of grammars, particularly context-free grammars (CFGs) and regular expressions (REs), to express the syntax of programming languages and protocols. The power of generative grammars to express ambiguity is crucial to their original purpose of modelling natural languages, but this very power makes it unnecessarily difficult both to express and to parse machine-oriented languages using CFGs. Parsing Expression Grammars (PEGs) provide an alternative, recognition-based formal foundation for describing machine-oriented syntax, which solves the ambiguity problem by not introducing ambiguity in the first place. Where CFGs express nondeterministic choice between alternatives, PEGs instead use prioritized choice. PEGs address frequently felt expressiveness limitations of CFGs and REs, simplifying syntax definitions and making it unnecessary to separate their lexical and hierarchical components. A linear-time parser can be built for any PEG, avoiding both the complexity and fickleness of LR parsers and the inefficiency of generalized CFG parsing. While PEGs provide a rich set of operators for constructing grammars, they are reducible to two minimal recognition schemas developed around 1970, TS/TDPL and gTS/GTDPL, which are here proven equivalent in effective recognition power. },

	Abstract = {Packrat parsing is a novel technique for implementing parsers in a lazy functional programming language. A packrat parser provides the power and flexibility of top-down parsing with backtracking and unlimited lookahead, but nevertheless guarantees linear parse time. Any language defined by an LL(k) or LR(k) grammar can be recognized by a packrat parser, in addition to many languages that conventional linear-time algorithms do not support. This additional power simplifies the handling of common syntactic idioms such as the widespread but troublesome longest-match rule, enables the use of sophisticated disambiguation strategies such as syntactic and semantic predicates, provides better grammar composition properties, and allows lexical analysis to be integrated seamlessly into parsing. Yet despite its power, packrat parsing shares the same simplicity and elegance as recursive descent parsing; in fact converting a backtracking recursive descent parser into a linear-time packrat parser often involves only a fairly straightforward structural change. This paper describes packrat parsing informally with emphasis on its use in practical applications, and explores its advantages and disadvantages with respect to the more conventional alternatives. },

	Abstract = {Coloring the nodes of a graph with a small number of colors is one of the most fundamental problems in theoretical computer science. In this paper, we study graph coloring in a distributed setting. Processors of a distributed system are nodes of an undirected graph G. There is an edge between two nodes whenever the corresponding processors can directly communicate with each other. We assume that distributed coloring algorithms start with an initial m-coloring of G. In the paper, we prove new strong lower bounds for two special kinds of coloring algorithms. For algorithms which run for a single communication round---i.e., every node of the network can only send its initial color to all its neighbors---, we show that the number of colors of the computed coloring has to be at least Ω(Δ2/log2 Δ+ log log m). If such one-round algorithms are iteratively applied to reduce the number of colors step-by-step, we prove a time lower bound of Ω(Δ/log2 Δ+ log*m) to obtain an O(Δ)-coloring. The best previous lower bounds for the two types of algorithms are Ω(log log m) and Ω(log*m), respectively. },

	Abstract = {The authors introduce a concept of network decomposition, a partitioning of an arbitrary graph into small-diameter connected components, such that the graph created by contracting each component into a single node has low chromatic number. They present an efficient distributed algorithm for constructing such a decomposition and demonstrate its use for design of efficient distributed algorithms. The method yields new deterministic distributed algorithms for finding a maximal independent set in an arbitrary graph and for ( Delta +1)-coloring of graphs with maximum degree Delta . These algorithms run in O(n/sup epsilon /) time for epsilon =O((log log n/log n)/sup 1/2/), whereas the best previously known deterministic algorithms required Omega (n) time. The techniques can also be used to remove randomness from the previously known most distributed breadth-first search algorithm. },

	Abstract = {Many large-scale networks such as ad hoc and sensor networks, peer-to-peer networks, or the Internet have the property that the number of independent nodes does not grow arbitrarily when looking at neighborhoods of increasing size. Due to this bounded "volume growth," one could expect that distributed algorithms are able to solve many problems more efficiently than on general graphs. The goal of this paper is to help understanding the distributed complexity of problems on "bounded growth" graphs. We show that on the widely used unit disk graph, covering and packing linear programs can be approximated by constant factors in constant time. For a more general network model which is based on the assumption that nodes are in a metric space of constant doubling dimension, we show that in O(log*!n) rounds it is possible to construct a (O(1), O(1))-network decomposition. This results in asymptotically optimal O(log*!n) time algorithms for many important problems. },

	Abstract = { We consider a class of geometric facility location problems in which the goal is to determine a set X of disks given by their centers (tj) and radii (rj) that cover a given set of demand points Y∈R2 at the smallest possible cost. We consider cost functions of the form Εjf(rj), where f(r)=rα is the cost of transmission to radius r. Special cases arise for α=1 (sum of radii) and α=2 (total area); power consumption models in wireless network design often use an exponent α>2. Different scenarios arise according to possible restrictions on the transmission centers tj, which may be constrained to belong to a given discrete set or to lie on a line, etc.We obtain several new results, including (a) exact and approximation algorithms for selecting transmission points tj on a given line in order to cover demand points Y∈R2; (b) approximation algorithms (and an algebraic intractability result) for selecting an optimal line on which to place transmission points to cover Y; (c) a proof of NP-hardness for a discrete set of transmission points in R2 and any fixed α>1; and (d) a polynomial-time approximation scheme for the problem of computing a minimum cost covering tour (MCCT), in which the total cost is a linear combination of the transmission cost for the set of disks and the length of a tour/path that connects the centers of the disks. },

	Abstract = {Given a finite set S of points (i.e. the stations of a radio network) on a d-dimensional Euclidean space and a positive integer 1 ≤ h ≤ |S| - 1, the MIN d D h-RANGE ASSIGNMENT problem consists of assigning transmission ranges to the stations so as to minimize the total power consumption, provided that the transmission ranges of the stations ensure the communication between any pair of stations in at most h hops.Two main issues related to this problem are considered in this paper: the trade-off between the power consumption and the number of hops; the computational complexity of the MIN dD h-RANGE ASSIGNMENT problem.As for the first question, we provide a lower bound on the minimum power consumption of stations on the plane for constant h. The lower bound is a function of |S|, h and the minimum distance over all the pairs of stations in S. Then, we derive a constructive upper bound as a function of |S|, h and the maximum distance over all pairs of stations in S (i.e. the diameter of S). It turns out that when the minimum distance between any two stations is "not too small" (i.e. well spread instances) the upper bound matches the lower bound. Previous results for this problem were known only for very special 1-dimensional configurations (i.e., when points are arranged on a line at unitary distance) [Kirousis, Kranakis, Krizanc and Pelc, 1997].As for the second question, we observe that the tightness of our upper bound implies that MIN 2D h-RANGE ASSIGNMENT restricted to well spread instances admits a polynomial time approximation algorithm. Then, we also show that the same approximation result can be obtained for random instances. On the other hand, we prove that for h=|S|-1 (i.e. the unbounded case) MIN 2D h-RANGE ASSIGNMENT is NP-hard and MIN 3D h-RANGE ASSIGNMENT is APX-complete. },

	Abstract = {Behavioral theories and Hoffman's information-processing theory have differing implications for how the effectiveness of parental discipline varies according to the level of distress experienced by the child. Consistent with behavioral theories, punishment was more effective in delaying the next recurrence of disobedience when toddlers' distress was high than when it was low or moderate. Consistent with Hoffman, reasoning and a punishment-reasoning combination were most effective at a moderate level of toddler distress. Thus, firm reasoning and a combination of reasoning with mild punishment are recommended.},

	Abstract = {Spreading cortical depression (SCD) is a slowly spreading supression of electroencephalogram (EEG) activity that was first observed in anaesthetized rabbits in 1944. Since then, the spatial properties of propagation have been investigated on numerous animal experiments. In the folded and complex human cortex, both the occurrence of SCD and the relationship between SCD and migraine have been discussed controversially. This study proposes a software tool to simulate the possible wavefront motion on the surface of human brain. The SCD wavefront motion has been simulated up to an affected surface region of roughly 150cm2 and validated by clinical experts. },

	Abstract = {In hippocampal slice models of epilepsy, two behaviors are seen: short bursts of electrical activity lasting 100 msec and seizure-like electrical activity lasting seconds. The bursts originate from the CA3 region, where there is a high degree of recurrent excitatory connections. Seizures originate from the CA1, where there are fewer recurrent connections. In attempting to explain this behavior, we simulated model networks of excitatory neurons using several types of model neurons. The model neurons were connected in a ring containing predominantly local connections and some long-distance random connections, resulting in a small-world network connectivity pattern. By changing parameters such as the synaptic strengths, number of synapses per neuron, proportion of local versus long-distance connections, we induced "normal," "seizing," and "bursting" behaviors. Based on these simulations, we made a simple mathematical description of these networks under well-defined assumptions. This mathematical description explains how specific changes in the topology or synaptic strength in the model cause transitions from normal to seizing and then to bursting. These behaviors appear to be general properties of excitatory networks.

	Abstract = {Complex living systems are difficult to understand. They obey the laws of physics and chemistry, but these basic laws do not explain their behaviour; each component part of a complex system participates in many different interactions and these interactions generate unforeseeable, emergent properties. For example, microscopic interactions between non-living molecules, at the macroscopic level, produce a living cell. Here we discuss how to explain such complexity in the format of a dynamic model that is mathematically precise, yet understandable. Precise, computer-aided modelling will make it easier to formulate novel experiments and attain understanding and control of key biological processes.

	Abstract = {Experiments have generated a plethora of data about the genes, molecules, and cells involved in thymocyte development. Here, we use a computer-driven simulation that uses data about thymocyte development to generate an integrated dynamic representation---a novel technology we have termed reactive animation (RA). RA reveals emergent properties in complex dynamic biological systems. We apply RA to thymocyte development by reproducing and extending the effects of known gene knockouts: CXCR4 and CCR9. RA simulation revealed a previously unidentified role of thymocyte competition for major histocompatability complex presentation. We now report that such competition is required for normal anatomical compartmentalization, can influence the rate of thymocyte velocities within chemokine gradients, and can account for the disproportion between single-positive CD4 and CD8 lineages developing from double-positive precursors.},

	Abstract = {One of the problems biologists face is a data set too large to comprehend in full. Experimenters generate data at an ever-growing pace, each from their own niche of interest. Current theories are each able, at best, to capture and model only a small part of the data. We aim to develop a general approach to modeling that will help broaden biological understanding. T-cell maturation in the thymus is a telling example of the accumulation of experimental data into a large disconnected data set. The thymus is responsible for the maturation of stem cells into mature T cells, and its complexity divides research into different fields, for example, cell migration, cell differentiation, histology, electron microscopy, biochemistry, molecular biology, and more. Each field forms its own viewpoint and its own set of data. In this study we present the results of a comprehensive integration of large parts of this data set. The integration is performed in a two-tiered visual manner. First, we use the visual language of Statecharts, which makes specification precise, legible, and executable on computers. We then set up a moving graphical interface that dynamically animates the cells, their receptors, the different gradients, and the interactions that constitute thymic maturation. This interface also provides a means for interacting with the simulation.

Computational models of the immune system can help to improve our understanding of its fundamental principles. In this article, we analyze and extend the Celada-Seiden model, a simple and elegant agent-based model of the entire immune response, which, however, lacks biophysically sound simulation methodology. We extend the stochastic model to a stochastic-deterministic hybrid, and link the deterministic version to continuous physical and chemical laws. This gives precise meaning to all simulation processes, and helps to increase performance. To demonstrate an application for the model, we implement and study two different hypotheses about T cell-mediated immune memory.},

One possible application is the prediction of the lethality of new Influenza A strains, which are constantly created due to antigenic drift and shift. Here, we present an agent-based model of immune-influenza A dynamics, with focus on low level molecular antigen-antibody interactions, in order to study antigenic drift and shift events, and analyze the virulence of emergent strains. At this stage of the investigation, results are presented and discussed from a qualitative point of view against recent and generally recognized immunology and influenza literature.},

	Abstract = {The immune system (IS) represents the defence mechanism of higher level organisms to micro organismic threats. It is a very complex system, genuinely distributed and providing mechanisms of adaptation to unknown threats by means of the interaction among the heterogenous autonomous entities it is composed of. The most relevant features of the overall system, such as learning capabilities and the possibility to tackle unknown threats in any part of the body, are a consequence of these interactions. This paper describes how a Multi-Agent approach, and more precisely the situated cellular agents (SCA) model, can be applied to represent specific elements and mechanisms of the IS. After a brief description of the IS, a brief overview of possible modelling approaches will be given, then the SCA model will be introduced and exploited to model some elements and mechanisms of the IS.

	Abstract = { Peripheral tissue microenvironments play an important role in determining responses to infection, but these small-scale interactions are usually not included in immune system models. An immune response to a pathogen involves numerous cells of several different types, each with a limited ability to sense its environment and to act. These cells produce many kinds of signalling molecules called cytokines that act locally to affect cell behavior. The dynamical interactions among this heterogeneous collection of cells and molecules are extremely complex. To begin to understand such a system, we need modeling approaches that can relate population-level dynamics to individual cell interactions and responses to cytokines. This thesis describes a spatially explicit simulator that tracks individual cell responses to local molecular signals, and the use of that simulator to study models of peripheral tissue dynamics in normal and disease conditions.

The simulator implements a hybrid framework combining discrete representation of individual cells and continuous representation of molecular concentrations. Cell behaviors consist of sensing, intracellular processing, and action functions that can be combined in various ways to accommodate a variety of models. Connecting extracellular signals to individual cell actions is difficult because intracellular signalling itself is complex and incompletely understood. Many of the processes involved occur on different timescales and stochastic effects may be important. The approach presented here abstracts away much of this intracellular signalling complexity, while capturing the aspects most likely to affect intercellular dynamics. Separation of sensing and processing allows the kind of pleiotropy seen in intercellular systems---each cytokine may affect multiple cell actions, and multiple cytokines may affect a single action.

The goal of this work is to relate individual cell actions and intercellular interactions to observed population-level dynamics. For concreteness, this study focuses on alveolar lung tissue and the response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In the absence of infection, a dynamic population of peripheral immune system effector cells provides a sentinel function. In an effective response to pathogenic challenge, this population expands and changes function to either eliminate the pathogen, or---as in many cases of tuberculosis---isolate it and minimize the effects on surrounding tissues. This requires recruitment and spatial organization of the right kinds of cells and appropriate regulation of their effector functions. The models presented here explore the relative importance of various regulatory mechanisms in effectively controlling a local population of immune cells. },

It provides a detailed introduction to concepts such as emergence, self-organized criticality, automata, networks, diversity, adaptation, and feedback. It also demonstrates how complex adaptive systems can be explored using methods ranging from mathematics to computational models of adaptive agents.</p><p> John Miller and Scott Page show how to combine ideas from economics, political science, biology, physics, and computer science to illuminate topics in organization, adaptation, decentralization, and robustness. They also demonstrate how the usual extremes used in modeling can be fruitfully transcended.</p>}},

	Abstract = { Dealing with uncertainty in dynamic environments is a basic challenge to autonomous systems. These systems are highly complex, involving large numbers of stochastic variables and many interacting nonlinear subsystems that operate at multiple time granularities. An autonomous system must be able to monitor the state of its components and environment to form informed plans of intelligent action. But monitoring is a challenge for large-scale systems, because the cost of exact inference grows exponentially with the number of state variables. Thus, approximate monitoring algorithms are needed.

Complex systems typically consist of loosely coupled subsystems. One approach to approximate monitoring exploits this idea by factoring the joint distribution of the system state into a product of marginal distributions over the subsystem states. However, sometimes this factoring approach is still computationally infeasible. An alternative approach to approximate monitoring is particle filtering (PF), in which the joint distribution over the system state is approximated by a set of samples or particles. In high dimensional spaces, the variance of PF is high and too many particles are required to provide good performance.

This thesis presents factored sampling, a new family of approximate monitoring algorithms, that combines the best qualities of these two methods. Instead of maintaining particles over the entire state of the system, we introduce factoring to the particle-based representation and maintain particles over clusters of state variables. This approach reduces the variance of PF, hence reducing its error. Maintaining factored particles also allows for tractable look-ahead prediction, so that the most recent evidence can be used to decide which particles to propagate, which dramatically improves accuracy.

This thesis also presents methods for continuous-time monitoring. For systems with intermittent events and observations, discrete-time monitoring is inefficient because inference is performed at fixed time steps, even when the system state remains unchanged. Thus, we present an algorithm for performing particle filtering in continuous time, such that reasoning is done only at the onset of interesting events, and show how learning of model parameters can be incorporated into this framework. A factored version of this algorithm, that uses the representation of factored particles, is also presented. },

In particular, we find that certain types of institutions--those that become more "politically unstable" as citizen heterogeneity increases--perform relatively poorly given a single jurisdiction, yet these same institutions perform relatively well when there are multiple jurisdictions. We provide an explanation for this phenomenon which draws upon simulated annealing, a discrete nonlinear search algorithm.},

	Abstract = {In order to reduce the scale and complexity, the decomposition methods of fuzzy cognitive maps for knowledge representation and reasoning are presented. Partition the vertices of original cognitive map into some groups, and then construct quotient cognitive map based on these groups. Thus, the analysis of the original FCM can be reduced to that of quotient FCM, which provides global information of original FCM, and some sub FCMs which keep an original topological structure and inference and provide local information of original FCM. It extremely reduces the original size and complexity, meanwhile, it is possible to study system at different slices and enhance the enrichment and flexibility of research between concepts. Some knowledge representations and reasoning of complex system use the method of hierarchical for fuzzy cognitive maps. Therefore, it highlights the hierarchical causal relationship and inclusion relationship between concepts, and embodies the space causal relation between concepts},

	Abstract = {To develop a parallel discrete-event simulation from scratch requires in-depth knowledge of the mapping process from the physical model to the simulation model, and also a substantial effort in coping with the numerous issues concerning the underlying synchronization protocols in use. Languages and libraries could reduce the devel opment effort significantly by providing the user with a pre-built parallel simulation kernel as well as application development tools. This pa per contains a survey of the existing languages and libraries for parallel discrete-event simula tion. It is divided into two major sections: one on the languages, the other on the libraries. The discussions are mainly focused on the following aspects: user model, programming framework and language features, library API, protocols, and system support and environment. The re ported performances of some packages are also summarized.

	Abstract = { The graphics processor (GPU) on today's commodity video cards has evolved into an extremely powerful and flexible processor. The latest graphics architectures provide tremendous memory bandwidth and computational horsepower, with fully programmable vertex and pixel processing units that support vector operations up to full IEEE floating point precision. High level languages have emerged for graphics hardware, making this computational power accessible. Architecturally, GPUs are highly parallel streaming processors optimized for vector operations, with both MIMD (vertex) and SIMD (pixel) pipelines. Not surprisingly, these processors are capable of general-purpose computation beyond the graphics applications for which they were designed. Researchers have found that exploiting the GPU can accelerate some problems by over an order of magnitude over the CPU.However, significant barriers still exist for the developer who wishes to use the inexpensive power of commodity graphics hardware, whether for in-game simulation of physics of for conventional computational science. These chips are designed for and driven by video game development; the programming model is unusual, the programming environment is tightly constrained, and the underlying architectures are largely secret. The GPU developer must be an expert in computer graphics and its computational idioms to make effective use of the hardware, and still pitfalls abound. This course provides a detailed introduction to general purpose computation on graphics hardware (GPGPU). We emphasize core computational building blocks, ranging from linear algebra to database queries, and review the tools, perils, and tricks of the trade in GPU programming. Finally we present some interesting and important case studies on general-purpose applications of graphics hardware.The course presenters are experts on general-purpose GPU computation from academia and industry, and have presented papers and tutorials on the topic at SIGGRAPH, Graphics Hardware, Game Developers Conference, and elsewhere. },

	Abstract = { With the introduction in 2003 of standard GPUs with 32 bit floating point numbers and programmable Vertex and Fragment processors, the processing power of the GPU was made available to non-graphics applications. As the GPU is aimed at computer graphics, the concepts in GPU-programming are based on computer graphics terminology, and the strategies for programming have to be based on the architecture of the graphics pipeline. At SINTEF in Norway a 4-year strategic institute project (2004-2007) "Graphics hardware as a high-end computational resource", http://www.math.sintef.no/gpu/ aims at making GPUs available as a computational resource both to academia and industry. This paper addresses the challenges of GPU-programming and results of the project's first year. },

	Abstract = {BSR (Broadcasting with Selective Reduction) is a PRAM more powerful than any CRCW PRAM. In order to extend the Broadcast Instruction of BSR and make it more useful for a large class of applications, this article permits it to use a general form of selection, specifically, an arbitrary relational expression. BSR with general selection is denoted by BSR+. Thus, BSR or BSR with k criteria (k>1) is BSR+ in a special case. An efficient implementation for the Broadcast Instruction of BSR+ is proposed, requiring (1/k)th of the circuits used by the best previous implementation of BSR with k criteria. Of all PRAMs, BSR+ is the most powerful in computation},

	Abstract = { A model of parallel computation called broadcasting with selective reduction (BSR) can be viewed as a concurrent-read concurrent-write (CRCW) parallel random access machine (PRAM) with one extension. An additional type of concurrent memory access is permitted in BSR, namely the BROADCAST instruction by means of which all N processors may gain access to all M memory locations simultaneously for the purpose of writing. At each memory location, a subset of the incoming broadcast data is selected and reduced to one value finally stored in that location. For several problems, BSR algorithms are known which require fewer steps than the corresponding best-known PRAM algorithms, using the same number of processors. A circuit is introduced to implement the BSR model, and it is shown that, in size and depth, the circuit presented is of the same order as an optimal circuit implementing the PRAM. Thus, if it is reasonable to assume that CRCW PRAM instructions execute in constant time, the assumption of a constant time BROADCAST instruction is no less reasonable. },

	Abstract = {This paper presents BSR-parallel algorithms for some problems in fundamental graph theory : transitive closure, connected components, spanning tree, bridges and articulation points of a graph and bipartite graph recognition. There already exist constant time algorithms to solve these problems on a mesh with reconfigurable bus system using O(N  4) processors. Here we show that these problems can be solved in constant time using only O(N  2) processors on the BSR model (N is the number of vertices of the graph G). Therefore, our algorithms are more work-efficient. These new results suggest that many other problems in graph theory can be solved in constant time using the BSR model.},

	Abstract = {Researchers have long been interested in the relationship between marital distress and depression. Empirical findings from investigations into the relative contributions of marital distress and depression to marital communication have been inconsistent, and some communication behaviors, such as the demand/withdraw interaction pattern, have yet to be examined. The ability of depression to predict major types of communication (positive communication, negative communication, problem-solving, and demand/withdraw) was analyzed after controlling the shared variance between marital distress and depression. Across two studies of couples beginning therapy and one study of couples beginning an enhancement program, results failed to provide support for a unique contribution of depression to couples' communication behaviors.

	Abstract = {This study examines the relationship between codependency and relational processes and outcomes. Couples (N = 68 dyads) including one depressed individual completed interviews about the strategies partners use to help curtail depression and completed measures of codependency, mental health, and relational cohesiveness and satisfaction. A control group of nondepressed couples (N=68 individuals) completed the self-report measures only. Results indicate partial support for an association between codependency and more negatively valenced control strategies as well as more consistent sequences of negative strategies. Codependency is found to moderate over-time changes in control strategies, supporting the contention that codependency is an individual-level trait. In couples including one depressed individual, codependency predicts more depression, negative cognitions, and anxiety and predicts lower cohesiveness but more relational satisfaction. In comparison couples, the predicted relation},

	Abstract = {An examination of the lives of 187 famous journalist-literary figures shows that a high proportion of them battled substance abuse and emotional health problems. This pattern fits in with research that shows a close relationship between artistic temperament and mental health difficulties. This article discusses the connection between these behaviors and the choice of journalism and writing as a career, and it examines whether journalism attracts personalities who project unhealthy psychic tensions onto the world. The fact that so many of the journalist-literary figures found themselves imprisoned in compulsive behaviors leads one to ponder the ironies of their lives that were lived for the sake of freedom and uninhibited artistic expression but ended up miserable for themselves and those around them. And it makes one wonder whether future journalist-literary figures will follow the same path. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR Copyright of Journalism History is the property of E.W. Scripps School o},

	Abstract = {Today, more than 14 million people reportedly suffer from depression, with the majority of that group being women. Due to the seemingly ubiquitous nature of this disease, this essay seeks to elucidate the ways in which we currently think and talk about women and depression. While previous scholars have explored the social context of women's depression in social scientific studies, this essay provides insight into the ways popular discourse constructs women and depression from a critical rhetoric paradigm. I argue that the dominant discourse about depression constructs women possessing detective bodies and passive minds; bodies that are sites of danger because of the unpredictable problems that result from women's "natural" susceptibility to depression. The culmination of these claims results in a powerful disciplinary mechanism---one that by encouraging maintenance of the female body functions to both silence the complexity of unique and wide-ranging experience and mask the cultural, so},

	Abstract = {About 10% of the US population suffers from depression (NIMH, 2000/2001) affecting both the client and his/her family members. This study applies Inconsistent Nurturing as Control Theory (Le Poire, 1994) to romantic relationships with depressed individuals (N=68 couples) and examines types and patterns of attempts to curtail depression. Results from in-depth interviews of depressed individuals and their partners suggest partners change their communication strategies over time such that they use more negative strategies before they label depression problematic, actively help and encourage depressed individuals more after the labeling, and revert to a less consistent sequence of positive and negative strategies after the initial control strategies have proven unsuccessful.

	Abstract = {We consider the problem of efficient MAC design for long-distance WiFi-based mesh networks. In such networks it is common to find long propagation delays, the use of directional antennas, and the presence of inter-link interference. Prior work has shown that these characteristics make traditional CSMA-based MACs a poor choice for long-distance mesh networks and this finding has led to several recent research efforts exploring the use of TDMA-based approaches to media access. In this paper we first identify, and then address, several shortcomings of current TDMA-based proposals. First, because they use fixed-length transmission slots, current TDMA-based solutions do not adapt to dynamic variations in traffic load leading to inefficiencies in both throughput and delay. As we show in this paper, the throughput achieved by existing solutions falls far short of the optimal achievable network throughput. Finally, due to the scheduling constraints imposed by inter-link interference, current TDMA-based solutions only apply to bipartite network topologies.

In this paper, we present JazzyMac, a simple, practical and efficient MAC protocol that addresses the above limitations. JazzyMac achieves efficiency by allowing variable-length link transmissions slots and then defining a distributed protocol by which nodes adapt the length of their transmission slots to changing traffic demands. JazzyMac is practical in that the adaptation at each node uses purely local information and that our protocol applies to arbitrary network topologies. Finally, the use of dynamic slot sizes allows JazzyMac to achieve better tradeoffs between throughput and delay.

We evaluate JazzyMac using detailed simulation over a range of traffic patterns and realistic topologies. Our results show that JazzyMac improves throughput in all considered scenarios. This improvement is often substantial (e.g.,in 50% of our scenarios, throughput improves by over 40%) and is particularly pronounced for the common case of asymmetric traffic (e.g.,leading to almost 100% improvements). Furthermore, compared to current solutions, JazzyMac can achieve much better average delay for the same throughput.},

	Abstract = {This paper focuses on the competitively optimal power control and signal shaping for "ad hoc" networks composed by multiple-antenna noncooperative transmit/receive terminals affected by spatially colored multiple-access interference (MAI). The target is the competitive maximization of the information throughput sustained by each link that is active over the network. For this purpose, the MAI-impaired network is modeled as a noncooperative strategic game, and sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium (NE) are provided. Furthermore, iterative power-control and signal-shaping algorithms are presented to efficiently achieve the NE under both best-effort and "contracted QoS" policies. The presented algorithms also account for the effect of (possibly) imperfect channel estimates available at the transmit/receive units active over the network, they are fully scalable, and they may be implemented in a fully distributed and asynchronous way. The presented numerical results support the conclusion that the proposed distributed algorithms may be able to outperform the conventional centralized orthogonal MAC strategies (as time division multiple access, frequency division multiple access, and code division multiple access) in terms of a sustained network throughput, especially in operating scenarios affected by a strong MAI},

	Abstract = {Over the past few years, wireless networking technologies have made vast forays into our daily lives. Today, one can find 802.11 hardware and other personal wireless technology employed at homes, shopping malls, coffee shops and airports. Present-day wireless network deployments bear two important properties: they are unplanned, with most access points (APs) deployed by users in a spontaneous manner, resulting in highly variable AP densities; and they are unmanaged, since manually configuring and managing a wireless network is very complicated. We refer to such wireless deployments as being chaotic.In this paper, we present a study of the impact of interference in chaotic 802.11 deployments on end-client performance. First, using large-scale measurement data from several cities, we show that it is not uncommon to have tens of APs deployed in close proximity of each other. Moreover, most APs are not configured to minimize interference with their neighbors. We then perform trace-driven simulations to show that the performance of end-clients could suffer significantly in chaotic deployments. We argue that end-client experience could be significantly improved by making chaotic wireless networks self-managing. We design and evaluate automated power control and rate adaptation algorithms to minimize interference among neighboring APs, while ensuring robust end-client performance. },

	Abstract = {Many areas have dense deployments of 802.11 wireless access points, often with little or no planning of the best choices of channel assignments. As a result, there is often very high interference due to poor channel assignments. One contributing factor is that many access points are deployed with the absolute minimum of configuration effort, which means they are assigned to the channel the manufacturer has chosen, as a default. In many cases, such minimal effort deployments also mean that the access point uses the manufacturer-default password. Inspired by Johnny Appleseed, a 19th century American altruist who wandered the wilderness planting apple trees for the use of others, we investigate a method by which an altruistic wardriver moving through a dense wireless deployment could take advantage of such minimally configured access points. Where possible, he could use the default passwords to log into the system and change the channel assignment to better suite the surrounding environment, reducing interference for all. We examine this solution in simulation using real data gathered by wardrivers in several locations. We demonstrate that even with some conservative assumptions on the number of access points our Johnny Appleseed could alter, simple single-pass algorithms can result in a 10% reduction of total interference in a dense wireless deployment. We discuss the legal and ethical implications of the approach.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the ability of a genetic algorithm to design cellular automata that perform computations. The computational strategies of the resulting cellular automata can be understood using a framework in which "particles" embedded in space-time configurations carry information and interactions between particles effect information processing. This structural analysis can also be used to explain the evolutionary process by which the strategies were designed by the genetic algorithm. More generally, our goals are to understand how machine-learning processes can design complex decentralized systems with sophisticated collective computational abilities and to develop rigorous frameworks for understanding how the resulting dynamical systems perform computation.},

	Abstract = {The notion of conceptual structure in CA rules that perform the density classification task (DCT) was introduced by [1]. Here we investigate the role of process-symmetry in CAs that solve the DCT, in particular the idea of conceptual similarity, which defines a novel search space for CA rules. We report on two new process-symmetric one-dimensional rules for the DCT which have the highest ``balanced'' performance observed to date on this task, as well as the highest-performing CA known to perform the DCT in two dimensions. Finally, we investigate the more general problem of assessing how different learning strategies (based on evolution and coevolution, with and without spatial distribution), previously compared by [2], are suited to exploit conceptual structure in learning CAs to perform collective computation.},

Its properties of low constraint on the continuity of objective function and joint of search space, and ability of adapting to dynamic environment make PSO become one of the most important swarm intelligence methods and evolutionary computation algorithms. The fundamental and standard algorithm is introduced firstly. Then the work on the algorithm improvement during the past years is surveyed, as well as the applications on the multi-objective optimization, neural networks and electronics, etc. Finally, the problems remaining unresolved and some directions of PSO research are discussed.},

	Abstract = { Situational information can enrich the interactions between a user and the services they wish to utilize. Such information encompasses details about the user, the physical environment and the computing resources. There are at least three key aspects in addressing this issue. Firstly, it is important to accurately capture or infer the requirements of the users in a timely fashion. Without precise information on what the users are hoping to achieve it is difficult to identify suitable services or sub-services that may fulfill (in part or fully) their information needs. Secondly, the nature of the available services determines the modes in which they may be adapted to the users' needs. Rigid, inflexible services may be difficult to tune to the information requirements of the users. Adaptive services, on the other hand, are well suited to dynamically modifying their behavior, within defined constraints. The third issue to be addressed is the on-the-fly combination of services to meet the users' requirements. This paper argues that current modeling (both of users and services) techniques, adaptive axes and personalization techniques used in current personalized information services, such as Adaptive Hypermedia Systems, may supply the basis for next generation adaptive collaborative services. },

	Abstract = {Some issues and techniques are discussed for compiling collection-oriented languages for use on parallel and vector machines. Techniques for translating nested parallelism into flat parallelism are described. A compiler that translates a subset of Paralation Lisp into the instruction set of a virtual machine is discussed. The instructions of the virtual machine are simple vector instructions which could be further translated to a broad class of architectures including vector machines, single-instruction parallel machines, and multiple-instruction parallel machines. Another translator is also implemented that translates the virtual machine instructions into instructions for the Connection Machine (CM-2). The quicksort example in this paper is executed on the CM-2. Since actual parallel hardware is usually flat in nature, these techniques are useful to implementors of high-level collection-oriented languages. These languages express parallelism in a natural way that at first does not appear to be supportable by massively parallel machines. These techniques form a bridge from the convenience and power of nested collections and operations to the speed and simplicity of machines like the CM-2},

	Abstract = {The immune response is a complex network of processes activated in a host upon infection. Pathogens seek to disrupt or evade these processes to ensure their own survival and proliferation. This article provides a systems-level analysis of the immune response against two related bacterial species in the Bordetella genus, B. bronchiseptica and B. pertussis. B. pertussis, the causative agent of whooping cough, has lost many of the virulence factors of its B. bronchiseptica-like progenitor, and is using different strategies for the modulation of the immune system. We have synthesized two separate network models for the interaction of these pathogens with their hosts. Each network is then translated into a predictive dynamic model and is validated by comparison with available experimental data. The model offers predictions regarding cytokine regulation and the effects of perturbations of the immune system, as well as the time course of infections in hosts that had previously encountered the pathogens. We experimentally validate the prediction that convalescent hosts can rapidly clear both pathogens, while antibody transfer cannot substantially reduce the duration of a B. pertussis infection. This type of modeling provides new insights into the virulence, pathogenesis, and host adaptation of disease-causing microorganisms and can be readily extended to other pathogens.},

	Abstract = {The area of intelligent systems is one of the most important and successful. Some definitions state that in some way, intelligent systems are a form of information system. This was successfully introduced from the research domain of artificial intelligence in information systems practice. According to some references, the hardest single part of building any system, either information, software or intelligent, is deciding what to build. No other part of conceptual work is so difficult as establishing the detailed technical requirements. The authors propose reusability to support and influence requirements engineering. Reusability is actually a very simple activity that is not even listed in most dictionaries. In the software environment, requirements, design models, algorithms, test documents and many other products of the software process can be reused. However, our approach is not concentrated on software reusability, but rather on database and intelligent systems reusability which are not so often reused, but they are the main goal of the MetaBase project (T. Welzer et al., 1998). MetaBase is an object oriented repository which provides a structure for archiving reusable database components of several applications not only medical information systems. All possible conceptual models are classified according to business domain and functional domain of their application domains. The structure of the repository allows not only storage of reusable database components of several applications but also classifying and comparing components from different applications (T. Welzer et al., 1998)},

	Abstract = {In this article, I discuss some recent ideas in complex systems on the topic of networks, contained in or inspired by three recent complex systems books. The general science of networks is the subject of Albert-Lazlo Barabasi's Linked [A.-L. Barabasi, Linked: The New Science of Networks, Perseus, New York, 2002] and Duncan Watts' Six Degrees [D. Watts, Six Degrees: The Science of a Connected Age, Gardner's Books, New York, 2003]. Commonalities among complex biological networks, e.g., immune systems, social insects, and cellular metabolism, and their relation to intelligence in computational systems are explored in the proceedings of a interdisciplinary conference on "Distributed Autonomous Systems" [L.A. Segel, I.R. Cohen (Eds.), Design Principles for the Immune System and Other Distributed Autonomous Systems, Oxford University Press, New York, 2001].The ideas discussed in the third book have led to me to propose four general principles of adaptive information processing in decentralized systems. These principles, and the relevance of "network thinking" for artificial intelligence (and vice versa), are the subject of the last two sections of the article.},

It is also generally understood that organizations, communities, and individuals are all complex entities. To state that organizations are adaptive complex enterprises (ACE) is neither novel nor new: What is new, however, is that we now have a language and a set of constructs that allow us to formally conceptualize and discuss these concepts. (See the sidebar for a brief discussion of the terms adaptive complex enterprises and complex adaptive systems.) },

	Abstract = {In this paper, we first identify several challenges in designing a joint channel assignment and routing (JCAR) protocol in heterogeneous multiradio multichannel multihop wireless networks (M3WNs) using commercial hardware [e.g., IEEE 802.11 Network Interface Card (NIC)]. We then propose a novel software solution, called Layer 2.5 JCAR, which resides between the MAC layer and routing layer. JCAR jointly coordinates the channel selection on each wireless interface and the route selection among interfaces based on the traffic information measured and exchanged among the two-hop neighbors. Since interference is one of the major factors that constrain the performance in a M3 WN, in this paper, we introduce an important channel cost metric (CCM) which actually reflects the interference cost and is defined as the sum of expected transmission time weighted by the channel utilization over all interfering channels (for each node). In CCM, both the interference and the diverse channel characteristics are taken into account. An expression for CCM is derived in terms of equivalent fraction of air time by explicitly taking the radio heterogeneity into consideration. Using CCM as one of the key performance measures, we propose a distributed algorithm (heuristic) that produces near-optimal JCAR solution. To evaluate the efficacy of our heuristics, we conduct extensive simulations using the network simulator NS2. To demonstrate implementation feasibility, we conducted various experiments for the proposed distributed JCAR algorithm on a multihop wireless network testbed with nine wireless nodes, each is equipped with single/multiple 802.11a/g cards. Both experimental and simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and implementation easiness of our proposed software solution},

	Abstract = {The MAC protocol of a cognitive radio (CR) device should allow it to access unused or under-utilized spectrum without (or with minimal) interference to primary users dynamically. To fulfill such a goal, we propose a cognitive MAC protocol using statistical channel allocation and call it SCA-MAC in this work. SCA-MAC is a CSMA/CA-based protocol, which exploits statistics of spectrum usage for decision making on channel access. For each transmission, the sender negotiates with the receiver on transmission parameters through the control channel. A model is developed for CR devices to evaluate the successful rate of transmission. A CR device should pass the threshold of the successful transmission rate via negotiation before it can begin a valid transmission on data channels. The operating range and channel aggregation are two control parameters introduced to maintain the MAC performance. To validate our ideas, we conducted theoretical analysis and simulations to show that SCA-MAC does improve the throughput performance and guarantee the interference to incumbents to be bounded by a predetermined acceptable rate. The proposed MAC protocol does not need a centralized controller, as the negotiation between the sender and the receiver is performed using the CSMA/CA-based algorithm.},

	Abstract = {One of the major advantages of wireless communication over wired is the flexibility when creating links between nodes. But this comes at a price as influences from outside the mesh network can distort communication between the nodes and even the nodes themselves interfere with each other. By carefully selecting channels where each link transmits data on, the interference can be minimized causing the throughput and end-to-end delay to be improved. We propose an algorithm that only uses locally distributed information to find the best channel selection for each link. The algorithm is independent of the used routing algorithm and scales well. Using simulations we will demonstrate scalability, convergence and finding an optimal solution.},

	Abstract = {A joint congestion control, channel allocation and scheduling algorithm for multi-channel multi-interface multi- hop wireless networks is discussed. The goal of maximizing a utility function of the injected traffic, while guaranteeing queue stability, is defined as an optimization problem where the input traffic intensity, channel loads, interface to channel binding and transmission schedules are jointly optimized by a dynamic algorithm. Due to the inherent NP-Hardness of the scheduling problem, a simple centralized heuristic is used to define a lower bound for the performance of the whole optimization algorithm. The behavior of the algorithm for different numbers of channels, interfaces and traffic flows is shown through simulations.},

	Abstract = {Channel allocation was extensively researched in the framework of cellular networks, but it was rarely studied in the ad-hoc wireless networks, especially in the multi-hop ad-hoc networks. In this paper, we study the problem of competitive multi-radio multi-channel allocation in multi-hop wireless networks in detail. We model the channel allocation problem as a static cooperative game, and then derive a min-max coalition-proof Nash equilibrium (MMCPNE) in this game. We study the existence of MMCPNE in the static game and prove the necessary and sufficient conditions for MMCPNE. Finally, we propose a two-step distributed algorithm that enable the selfish players to converge to MMCPNE.},

	Abstract = {This paper studies the fundamental problem of clock synchronization in IEEE 802.11-based multihop ad hoc networks. Clock synchronization is important for power saving, network throughput and many basic operations of 802.11 protocols in a multihop ad hoc network (MANET). The scalability problem of 802.11 timing synchronization has been studied extensively in single hop ad hoc networks and good solutions are available. However these solutions do not perform well in the MANET environment. A few multihop solutions were proposed; but the performance is still not very good. The maximum clock offset is still over 200 mus for these protocols. In this paper, we propose an adaptive protocol through beacon transmission prioritization, frequency adjustment and construction of dominating set. The frequency adjustment is proved to be bounded. Simulation shows that we are able to control the maximum clock offset under 50 mus after protocol stabilization. The improvement is more than 400% over the current solutions with similar complexity. The new protocol also shows great long-term stability},

The aim of this paper is to show the limitations of using IEEE 802.11 distributed coordination function (DCF) based schemes for medium access control (MAC) in such antennas. We provide four different variants of IEEE 802.11 DCF based on-demand protocols to study this phenomenon. Our simulation results and analyses emphasize the need to develop a novel MAC protocol to fully exploit the capabilities of multiple beam antennas.

	Abstract = {Multicast routing protocols based on shared trees employ one or more rendezvous points (usually called cores) for coordination. To address fault tolerance in case of core failure, multiple cores can be deployed. The location of cores is crucial for the performance of the protocol. In this context, the problem of finding the location for the cores is similar to the (k, r)-predominating set problem, (k, r)-DS, in graph theory. That is, (k, r)-DS is defined as the problem of selecting a subset of nodes D such that the remaining nodes are within distance r from at least k nodes in D. In mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), finding the location of cores should be computed distributively, because the topology may change frequently. We present a distributed solution to the (k, r)-DS problem, named DKR, which is used for core selection in a novel multicast protocol named core hierarchical election for multicasting in ad hoc networks (CHEMA). CHEMA is designed to operate in the context of multiple channels and multiple interfaces. One interface is dedicated for the communication among cores and members, using a non-interfering channel. The performance of CHEMA is compared against one of the best performing multicast protocols to date. CHEMA is shown to perform better in all scenarios considered},

	Abstract = {We introduce a medium access control protocol for ad hoc networks. The new protocol, which we call ORMA (opportunistic reservation multiple access) is aimed at providing both high throughput and bounded channel access delays, which are critical for supporting integrated voice and data services over ad hoc networks. In ORMA, the channel is divided into a random access section and a scheduled access section. The first is used to exchange neighborhood information, the latter is used for data transmissions over time slots organized in frames, with each time slot being accessed through reservations or probabilistic elections. To attain high throughput, nodes access data slots based on a fair election in which they win with a certain probability. To attain bounded channel access delays, nodes reserve time slots by using a novel opportunistic reservation. The performance of ORMA is studied by both analysis and simulations. It is also compared against the performance of schemes based entirely on probabilistic or fixed conflict-free slot assignment},

	Abstract = {Mobile ad hoc networks have typically used the IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol with a single interface and a unique channel to transfer data. The trend to use multiple interfaces and multiple channels was only in mesh networks or in cellular networks. This paper is a state of art on multi-hop ad hoc networks where one uses more than one interface and more than one channel. We analyzed recent advances concerning MAC protocols and adapted routing protocols. This description of related work is followed by a discussion on open research issues related to this theme. We focus on throughput-oriented approaches},

	Abstract = {We consider the channel assignment problem for multihop wireless networks in which nodes have multiple interfaces. Given the number of interfaces at each node and available channels in the system, we find a feasible channel assignment to improve network performance. Even when routing is given, finding a channel assignment for optimal performance is NP-hard. We present the SAFE (skeleton assisted partition FrEe) channel assignment scheme, which uses randomized channel assignment in a distributed manner while maintaining network connectivity. SAFE can utilize all independent channels in the system while attempting to distribute edges sharing a particular channel evenly throughout the network. To handle topology change and incremental deployment better, SAFE decouples the channel assignment problem from routing. Our simulation results show that SAFE significantly improves network performance in terms of throughput and delay and is comparable to the best prior centralized scheme that jointly considers routing and channel assignment},

	Abstract = {We propose a contention-free medium access control (MAC) protocol for inter-vehicle communication systems that share information for the improvement of safety drive on the highway. In the proposed system, contention-free medium access is achieved by periodical one-way token transmissions. The token contains the frame information about the transmission/reception phase. While the token is relaid by one-way, the vehicle which has the token can send a packet to both up- and down-link. The token transmission interval is set not to be interfered from other transmit vehicles at a receive vehicle. In addition, multiple channels are used and allocated dynamically for every token transmission to reduce the transmission waiting time. We also evaluate the maximum end-to-end transmission delay of the proposed protocol, and clarify that the proposed protocol can guarantee the transmission within allowable delay time.},

	Abstract = {The tremendous success of the Institute of Electronics and Electrical Engineering (IEEE) 802.11 wireless local area network (WLAN) standard led to severe competition. Due to Wi-Fi Alliance (WFA)'s marketing, 802.11 became a universal solution for wireless connectivity. However, still a WLAN depends on wired infrastructure that interconnects the central access points (APs). To become independent of backbone networks leading to cheap deployments, the traditional single-hop approach needs to be replaced by wireless mesh networks (WMNs). Since several years, the research community develops routing protocols designed for wireless multi-hop networks. With 802.11s an integrated WMN approach is under development that adds the necessary functionality for interworking, security and routing. As its medium access control (MAC), 802.11s relies on the existing schemes. However, the current 802.11 MAC has been designed for wireless single-hop networks. Its application to WMNs leads to low performance. The capacity of the wireless medium can hardly be exploited. Thus, 802.11s provides an optional MAC that has been specifically designed for WMN. In this paper we explain the fundamental operation of the 802.11s MAC, explain its extensions and provide detailed simulation results on their performance.},

A novel self- synchronization algorithm is proposed for IEEE802.11 interface in TDMA-based ad hoc network, in which the advantage of RBS is exploited for the leading node election. Here, it overcomes shortcomings of previous methods by adopting a novel and efficient clock updating algorithm. The proposed scheme can be successfully applied to support real time applications such as voice calls over the multi-hop ad hoc network. The preliminary analytical results yields that the maximum clock offset is within 10 mus.},

	Abstract = {To overcome the lack of strict QoS guarantees in existing hotspots, in this paper we present a system for realtime traffic support in 802.11 networks that works in either infrastructure or ad-hoc mode. The proposed mechanism, called elastic MAC (E-MAC) protocol, helps stations with real-time traffic to organize and establish a transmission schedule in a distributed manner, while coexisting with standard 802.11 stations. This distributed scheduling guarantees very short delays and a minimum reserved data rate for real-time stations, while protecting best-effort 802.11 traffic from starvation. Another feature of our mechanism is time-slot reuse, which improves the network efficiency by allowing other real-time stations to take over unused slots (e.g., in case of using voice codecs with silence suppression). We evaluate the performance of our system using a testbed implementation, ns-2 simulations and a mathematical model, and show how it outperforms other QoS schemes (e.g., 802.11e) in terms of throughput, delay, and jitter.},

	Abstract = {This paper introduces a scheduled-access, multi-channel medium access control (MAC) framework for wireless multi-hop ad hoc networks (MANETs). The proposed framework dubbed dynamic multi-channel medium access, or DYNAMMA, features: (1) ability to dynamically adapt to application-specific traffic patterns, (2) collision-free, multi-channel operation, (3) energy efficiency, and (4) minimum signaling overhead. We evaluate DYNAMMA through extensive simulations and compare its performance against scheduled-access (e.g., TRAMA) and contention-based (e.g., 802.11) MAC protocols for different application scenarios. Our results show that DYNAMMA's ability to perform collision-free transmission over multiple channels significantly increases system capacity through higher channel utilization and spatial re-use. When compared to TRAMA, DYNAMMA's efficiency in terms of signaling overhead yields considerable energy savings as well as queueing delay reduction. We also present an implementation of DYNAMMA over an Ultra-Wideband (UWB) radio testbed. Our UWB testbed results indicate that DYNAMMA can achieve both high channel utilization (close to 90% for our experiments) and high energy efficiency (nodes, on average, sleep one third of the time).},

	Abstract = {We address the problem of improving the throughput in multi-hop ad hoc networks. Many approaches can be considered to address this issue. We focus on those that imply the use of multiple radio interfaces with separate radio channels. In this context, we need to address two important issues, namely channel assignment and routing. We propose a throughput-oriented scheme called IC2A2R. It allows nodes to use the best channel available in their neighborhood based on a channel selection algorithm. It also extends the OLSR protocol with a new routing metric to take into account both channel diversity and channel alternation. Simulation tests of the enhanced OLSR protocol show that it significantly improves the throughput and outperforms existing solutions such as WCETT.},

	Abstract = {Providing strong QoS guarantees for wireless multi-hop networks is very challenging, due to many factors such as use of a shared communication medium, variability in wireless link quality, and so on. However, wireless mesh technology gives the opportunity to alleviate some of these problems, due to lack of mobility in the wireless infrastructure, and presence of natural centralization points in the network. The main contribution of this paper is the definition of a simple framework that exploits these features to provide provable, strong QoS guarantees to network clients. In particular, admitted clients are guaranteed a certain minimum bandwidth and maximum delay on their connections. The framework is based on STDMA scheduling at the MAC layer, which is periodically executed at the network manager to adapt to changes in traffic demand. While scheduling computation is centralized, admission control is performed locally at the wireless backbone nodes, thus reducing signaling. We propose two bandwidth distribution and related admission control policies, which are at opposite ends of the network utilization/spatial fairness trade-off. Through extensive simulations, we show that the proposed framework achieves its design goals of providing strong QoS guarantees to VoIP clients while not sacrificing throughput in a realistic mesh network scenario, also in presence of highly unbalanced load at the backbone nodes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first proposal with similar features for wireless mesh networks.},

	Abstract = {The capacity of a wireless network has been widely studied in the literature, including the capacity for unicast and the capacity for broadcast. In this paper, we studied the capacity of a wireless network for broadcast. Previous studies on broadcast capacity either assume that all links in the wireless network has the same channel capacity, or assume that the transmission ranges of a wireless node can be arbitrarily large. In this paper we derive analytical upper bounds and lower bounds on broadcast capacity of a wireless network when all nodes in the network has the same bounded transmission power P and all nodes are placed in a square of side-length a. When the fixed data rate channel is used (each node can send W bits/second to nodes within its transmission range if no interference happened), we prove that the broadcast capacity is Theta(W) under the physical interference model. When the Gaussian channel capacity is used, we show that the total broadcast capacity is only Theta((alpharadic(log n/n))-beta) when alpharadic(log n/n) rarr infin. When a alpharadic(log n/n) rarr O(1), we show that the broadcast capacity is Theta(1). We also generalize our results to multicast capacity for physical interference model.},

In such mobile networks, lack of infrastructure leads to non trivial information discovery and dissemination. A scheme in which a unique object centralizes information is not efficient for many reasons. We propose a probabilistic algorithm to distribute an information token satisfactorily among nodes forming the network by using localized data. Then, in order to limit the number of memorizing nodes, we propose to make memorizing nodes belong to a dominating set.},

	Abstract = { We focus on self-contention: contention between packets of the same transport layer connection along the path from source to destination. We observe that self-contention plays an important role in degrading TCP performance in multi-hop wireless networks and that the use of the popular IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol exacerbates self-contention. We propose and study two MAC-layer approaches to alleviate self-contention. The first approach, called quick-exchange (QE), is designed with the intent of reducing the effects of inter-flow self-contention (e.g. between packets of the same connection traveling in opposite directions). The design of our second mechanism, called fast-forward (FF), is geared towards decreasing intra-flow self-contention (e.g. between packets of the same connection traveling in the same direction). We simulate and study our proposed schemes and observe that quick-exchange consistently improves net-work aggregate goodput (by as much as 20% in string topologies, 15% in random static scenarios, and 10% in random mobile scenarios). In contrast to our expectations, fast-forward causes sporadic and often negative effects on goodput for TCP connections. Upon investigation we find that while the MAC is, in some respect, operating more efficiently, as demonstrated by improved UDP throughput; interactions with TCPs congestion control mechanism cause the goodput to degrade. We analyze various effects that cause the respective behaviors with QE and FF in detail.},

	Abstract = { Internet-based mobile ad hoc network (IMANET) combines a mobile ad hoc network (MANET) and the Internet to provide universal information accessibility. Although caching frequently accessed data items in mobile terminals (MTs) improves the communication performance in an IMANET, it brings a critical design issue when data items are updated. We analyze several push and pull-based cache invalidation strategies for IMANETS. A global positioning system (GPS) based connectivity estimation (GPSCE) scheme is first proposed to assess the connectivity of an MT for supporting any cache invalidation mechanism. Then, we propose a pull-based approach, called aggregate cache based on demand (ACOD) scheme, to find the queried data items efficiently. In addition, we modify two push-based cache invalidation strategies, proposed for cellular networks, to work in IMANETs. These are a modified timestamp (MTS) scheme, and an MTS with updated invalidation report (MTS+UIR) scheme. Simulation results indicate that our proposed strategy provides high throughput, low query latency, and low communication overhead, and thus, is a viable approach for implementation in IMANETS.},

	Abstract = { This work concerns the comparative performance evaluation of protocols for clustering and backbone formation in ad hoc networks characterized by a large number of resource-constrained nodes. A typical example of these networks are wireless sensor networks. The DCA protocol represents those protocols whose backbone construction method is based on selecting nodes as clusterheads and then joining them to form a connected backbone. The algorithm proposed by Wu and Li has been chosen to exemplify those algorithms that build a connected backbone and then prune away redundant nodes. Finally, the algorithm by Wan et al. has been considered here for its more theoretical properties of producing a backbone with a constant approximation factor, linear time complexity and optimal message complexity. In order to obtain a backbone reasonably small at reasonable cost we propose an enhancement of the DCA algorithm, termed DCA-S, which enriches the DCA backbone construction with a recently proposed and resource effective sparsification rule. DCA-S leads to a robust backbone close in size to that generated by the Wan et al. protocol without significantly degrading the performance in terms of all the other relevant metrics.},

Inevitably, the communication tends to be inefficient in terms of computational and network resources. Study on virtual infrastructures or backbones in wireless ad-hoc networks gets more attention in the hope of reducing the communication overhead. But the backbone structure is very vulnerable due to various factors like node mobility, unstable links, and so on. So a new scheme which is reliable and efficient both to construct and maintain the backbone structure is needed. We present our noble virtual backbone scheme which is reliable and efficient by considering stability and coverage of nodes.},

	Abstract = { A key step in controlling topology in ad hoc networks is the construction of the backbone which is then used to transfer data. Nodes that are not part of the backbone can then go to sleep to save energy and increase the lifetime of the network. Centralized backbone construction algorithms give better performance but incur high communication overhead, while localized algorithms lack sufficient topology information needed to construct efficient backbones. We present selective backbone construction (SBC) which starts by selecting a small number of seed nodes in the backbone and then completes its construction by making a sweep of the network spreading outwards from the seed nodes. During the latter process, topology information is transferred to allow better coordinator selection decisions. We compared SBC with other power-saving protocols in a variety of tests featuring different mobility levels, traffic patterns, and node densities. Our experiments show that SBC is more efficient in saving energy and extending network life while providing satisfactory network performance when compared with 802.11, 802.11 PSM, and GAF.},

Attendant with this trend in model building is the growing importance of the model builder's implementation approach which requires he or she to be flexible and selective in the application of methods and computer tools. This paper relates the capabilities of a model development language called XSIM to the growing decentralization of the corporate financial modeling application. Specifically, the use of XSIM to build model systems addresses two key aspects of project implementation: adapting to new applications and accommodating the evolving requirements of a planning system.  },

	Abstract = { Risky investments are analyzed through a computer simulation process or with the use of the risk-adjusted discount rate and certainty-equivalent coefficient. A constant risk-adjusted discount rate or certainty-equivalent coefficient is frequently used in the evaluation of risky projects, while a constant risk-aversion coefficient is used in the simulation approach. The question raised in this paper is that one's consistent risk attitude is properly reflected in the risk analysis. Each approach was compared to each other to see if the risk-adjusted discount rate and certainty-equivalent coefficient become constant when the risk-aversion coefficient is held constant. Namely, this paper shows that the risk-adjusted discount rate and certainty-equivalent coefficient should be different from project to project to have a consistent risk attitude. Indeed, if a constant risk-adjusted discount rate or certainty-equivalent coefficient is used, variant risk-aversion coefficients or risk attitudes would be the result.  },

	Abstract = { Simulation is one of the most powerful analysis tools available to those responsible for the design and/or operation of complex processes or systems. It is heavily based upon computer science, mathematics, probability theory and statistics: yet the process of simulation modeling and experimentation remains very much an intuitive art. Simulation is a very general and somewhat ill-defined subject. For the purpose of this paper, we will define simulation as, ``the process of designing a computerized model of a system (or process) and conducting experiments with this model for the purpose either of understanding the behavior of the system and/or of evaluating various strategies for the operation of the system.'' Thus we will understand the process of simulation to include both the construction of the model and the analytical use of the model for studying a problem.  },

	Abstract = { The purposes of this tutorial are to present some fundamental properties of econometric model structures relevant to effective understanding of simulation procedures, and to describe the use of simulation software for analysis and forecasting. The fundamental concepts of model specification are developed formally to provide a logical foundation for model construction and simulation procedures. The concepts of integrated and causal structures, reduced and final forms are examined and related to issues of: empirical identification and statistical estimation; interpretation; and computation. Procedures for decomposition of causal systems into ordered subsets of equations are outlined. The formal analysis is supplemented with specific examples. The dynamic simulation capabilities of several available simulation software systems are described in general terms and specific procedures for loading and simulating econometric models with the California Economic Forecasting Project/Interactive Model Simulator (CEFP/IMS) system are given. Procedures for generation of' dynamic multipliers, incorporation of judgment in forecasting and forecast error analyses are discussed. The session is concluded with an on-line demonstration of the CEFP/IMS.  },

	Abstract = {This paper describes a simulation model that was developed to help a company analyze and improve its rules for purchasing one of its key raw materials. The material is traded on a commodity market and the company had successfully developed a system for forecasting price changes in the commodity market. The corporate executives were interested in evaluating the sales and returns that could be expected when various constraints were placed on commodity trading. The simulation was initially developed to address these questiond on trading limits and subsequently expanded to provide a basis for analyzing the trading system itself.},

	Abstract = {There is still much that is unknown about the interactions among financial markets, and about the relationships between stock prices and exchange rates. This topic gains attention during financial crises, and many papers try to find empirical regularities emerging from financial data, or to study contagion processes. In this paper we present a study on the interplay between two stock markets and one foreign exchange market extending the framework provided by the Genoa Artificial Stock Market. There are four different trading strategies, and the agents are divided into two groups: those who trade in the stock markets and those who trade in the FOREX. We studied three market conditions: the FOREX dynamics, the behavior of the two stock markets together with the FOREX, and finally we conducted a what-if analysis for testing the effects of a inflationary monetary shock of one currency affecting all of the three markets.},

	Abstract = {n this paper, a general equilibrium model of a monetary production economy is presented. The model is characterized by three classes of agents: a representative firm, heterogeneous households, and the government. Two markets (i.e., a labour market and a goods market, are considered) and two assets are traded in exchange of money, namely, government bonds and equities. Households provide the labour force and decide on consumption and savings, whereas the firm provides consumption goods and demands labour. The government receives taxes from households and pays interests on debt. The Walrasian equilibrium is derived analytically. The dynamics through quantity constrained equilibria out from the Walrasian equilibrium is also studied by means of computer simulations.},

	Abstract = {In this report we present ASPEN, a new agent based microeconomic simulation model of the U.S. economy being developed at Sandia National Laboratories (SNL). The model is notable because it allows a large number of individual economic agents to be modeled at a high level of detail and with a great degree of freedom. Some of the features of ASPEN are (a) a sophisticated message passing system which allows individual pairs of agents to communicate with one another, (b) the use of genetic algorithms to simulate certain agents' learning, and (c) a detailed financial sector which includes a banking system and a bond market. Results from runs of the model are also presented.},

	Abstract = {This article presents an agent-based integrated model of a real, financial, and monetary economy. The model is characterized by a monopolist firm that supplies a single homogeneous product in the goods market, hires workers in the labor market, and demands loans in the credit market; a trade union that sets the nominal wage; N heterogeneous households that buy the consumption good, provide the labor force, and trade the firm's equity in the stock market; and a bank that lends money to the firm at an interest rate set according to a monetary policy strategy. The model is used to perform monetary policy experiments. A monetary policy rule which targets the gap between the current output and the potential output in the full employment case is investigated, studying the effects on the economy for different degrees of policy tightness. The monetary policy rule is compared to a random policy rule that conserves a similar structure. Results show that a tight monetary policy clearly over performs the random policy rule. Moreover, results corroborate the effectiveness of monetary policy in limiting inflation and increasing welfare.},

	Abstract = {This article is devoted to the use of agent based approach for simulation of socio-economic processes. Structures of the agents and prototype of the simulation model the municipal union are developed.
The main idea of our approach is to combine system dynamics and agent based modeling. Simulation models are constructed in order to simulate a real city including all necessary stochastic and nonlinear elements. Such simulation models are used as proving grounds for analyzing and improving a real situation on a trial-and-error basis.
We present a possible way of using this approach to create an automated decision-making support systems (DMSS) for government of municipal union.},

	Abstract = { Traditional economic theory sees human economic decisions as rational choices of action to achieve maximum utility. However, economic reality shows that people often behave in ways different from that ideal: actions are not always determined rationally; often they are influenced by other factors, such as chance and tradition. In order to describe the behaviour of economic agents in the real world, we take irrationality and adaptation into account: we present work in progress on a market simulation that shows the effects of partly irrational and adaptive consumer buying decisions on the course of action of entrepreneurs.  },

	Abstract = {One might view the international political world as a system of nations, each described by a unique transfer function. Existing system engineering methods and computer techniques might then be applied to this multi-variable system with the hope that a better understanding might be achieved for the rise of international problems and their subsequent solution.

This paper describes the design, and actual demonstration by analog computer techniques, of a colonial socio-economic system which included national growth and national behavior models.

The national growth model included such variables as resource, opportunity and incentive with the hopes of evaluating the asymptotic behavior of the total population. The national behavior model described which one of the two political alternatives would be advocated by elements of the organized native class based on the environment defined by the growth model.},

	Abstract = {The computer power required in the simulation of mutually cooperating systems in the physical sciences is huge. Therefore, it is common to simulate one system and treat others as parameters or environmental conditions to the simulated system. Macro-micro interlocked (MMI) simulation framework has been proposed to simulate such cooperating systems. In this paper, we study the feasibility of applying this framework on the simulation of macro-micro economic model. This simulation allows us to observe the system's behaviour at the macro and micro levels concurrently. Policy changes at the macroeconomic level may affect the behaviour of the entities at the microeconomic level. Similarly, the behaviour changes at the microeconomic level may affect the macroeconomic system. We implement an MMI simulation library suitable for execution on a cluster of PCs. At this early stage, the experiment shows a promising result which provides us with a foundation to experiment with a larger model.},

	Abstract = {We present a new set of distributed algorithms for scheduling sensors to enhance the total lifetime of a wireless sensor network. These algorithms are based on constructing minimal cover sets each consisting of one or more sensors which can collectively cover the local targets.  Some of the covers are heuristically better than others for a sensor trying to decide its own sense-sleep status.  This leads to various ways to assign priorities to the covers. The algorithms work by having each sensor transition through these possible prioritized cover sets, settling for the best cover it can negotiate with its neighbors.   A local lifetime dependency graph consisting of the cover sets as nodes with any two nodes connected if the corresponding covers intersect captures the interdependencies among the covers. We present several variations of the basic algorithmic framework.  The priority function of a cover is derived from its degree or connectedness in the dependency graph - usually lower the better.  Lifetime improvement is 10% to 20% over the existing algorithms, while maintaining comparable communication overheads.   We also show how previous algorithms can be formulated within our framework. },

Such a coloring is called a distance-edge-coloring or an @?-edge-coloring of G. The distance-edge-coloring problem is to compute the minimum number of colors required for a distance-edge-coloring of a given graph G. A partial k-tree is a graph with tree-width bounded by a fixed constant k. We first present a polynomial-time exact algorithm to solve the problem for partial k-trees, and then give a polynomial-time 2-approximation algorithm for planar graphs.},

	Abstract = {We study the problem of supporting VoIP calls in a wireless mesh network. Specifically, we propose solutions for call admission control (CAC) and route selection for VoIP calls. Call admission decisions must evaluate how the capacity of the mesh network is utilized by the existing calls. We address this issue via a measurement-based modeling effort to model mutual interference between wireless links. The modeling approach evaluates whether capacity constraints (or, required QoS metrics) will be satisfied if a new call is admitted with a given route. Evaluations with a 6-node 802.11a testbed demonstrate excellent accuracy of the model and thus also the CAC performance. We address the issue of route selection by also using a modeling approach that considers models of transmission and interference ranges to develop a polynomial-time algorithm to search for feasible routes. This problem takes exponential time for wireless networks without such modeling. In addition to studying feasibility, we study several routing metrics such as shortest feasible path and maximum residual feasible path. Finally, we develop a new method for routing using call statistics that uses prior calling patterns to avoid potentially critical links. We evaluate the performance of these route selection techniques via extensive simulations and demonstrate the superiority of using max residual feasible path over simply shortest feasible path, and routing using call statistics over max residual feasible path.},

	Abstract = {A newly deployed multi-hop radio network is unstructured and lacks a reliable and efficient communication scheme. In this paper, we take a step towards analyzing the problems existing during the initialization phase of ad hoc and sensor networks. Particularly, we model the network as a multi-hop quasi unit disk graph and allow nodes to wake up asynchronously at any time. Further, nodes do not feature a reliable collision detection mechanism, and they have only limited knowledge about the network topology. We show that even for this restricted model, a good clustering can be computed efficiently. Our algorithm efficiently computes an asymptotically optimal clustering. Based on this algorithm, we describe a protocol for quickly establishing synchronized sleep and listen schedule between nodes within a cluster. Additionally, we provide simulation results in a variety of settings.},

	Annote = {The authors present an algorithm for initialization and time division of a naive ad hoc network. The algorithm presented solves the problem under the circumstance that the nodes all have the same value for the total number of nodes in the network. This is a known condition to improve running time, although the maximum degree of the network will also work as a factor. The authors make a point that their algorithm works on an asynchronously intializing network, which separates this work from other work in the field. The algorithm presented solves the initialization problem only by dividing the network into clusters, where ever node is either a cluster head or in communication with a cluster head, and the cluster heads form the backbone of the network.},

	Abstract = {We study efficient link scheduling for a multihop wireless network to maximize its throughput. Efficient link scheduling can greatly reduce the interference effect of close-by transmissions. Unlike the previous studies that often assume a unit disk graph model, we assume that different terminals could have different transmission ranges and different interference ranges. In our model, it is also possible that a communication link may not exist due to barriers or is not used by a predetermined routing protocol, while the transmission of a node always result interference to all non-intended receivers within its interference range. Using a mathematical formulation, we develop synchronized TDMA link schedulings that optimize the networking throughput. Specifically, by assuming known link capacities and link traffic loads, we study link scheduling under the RTS/CTS interference model and the protocol interference model with fixed transmission power. For both models, we present both efficient centralized and distributed algorithms that use time slots within a constant factor of the optimum. We also present efficient distributed algorithms whose performances are still comparable with optimum, but with much less communications. Our theoretical results are corroborated by extensive simulation studies.},

	Abstract = { During and immediately after their deployment, ad hoc and sensor networks lack an efficient communication scheme rendering even the most basic network coordination problems difficult. Before any reasonable communication can take place, nodes must come up with an initial structure that can serve as a foundation for more sophisticated algorithms. In this paper, we consider the problem of obtaining a vertex coloring as such an initial structure. We propose an algorithm that works under the unstructured radio network model. This model captures the characteristics of newly deployed ad hoc and sensor networks, i.e. asynchronous wake-up, no collision-detection, and scarce knowledge about the network topology. Our algorithm produces a correct coloring with O(Delta) colors in time O(Delta log n) with high probability in a unit disk graph, where n and Delta are the number of nodes in the network and the maximum degree, respectively. Furthermore, the number of locally used colors depends only on the local node density.

This is seen as an important first step in solving for $k>1$, however, it is not shown that this is the case. The algorithm is essentially a clustering algorithm, local nodes compete to become dominant in their area and these dominant nodes form the basis of the structured network.The algorithm transforms the graph into a tree in polyalgorithmic time. A disadvantage of this approach is the potential loss of redundant paths through the network.},

	Abstract = {The problem of coloring graph vertices, known to be NP-complete, is discussed. We present an alternative solution to this problem as a distributed simulation which uses a parallel randomized heuristic algorithm for making local decisions to color graph vertices. The algorithm is based on an inter-particle system from statistical mechanics. Since the algorithm works locally, it is likely to be highly parallel. The simulation of a coloring process on n vertices of a graph can be seen as a set of n distributed processes running in parallel. The simulation algorithm is implemented in Occam 2 language and run on a transputer system.

	Abstract = {We consider the problem of deterministic distributed coloring of an n-vertex graph with maximum degree $\Delta$, assuming that every vertex knows a priori only its own label and parameters n and $\Delta$. The aim is to get a fast algorithm using few colors. Linial [17] showed a vertex-coloring algorithm working in time O(logn) and using O($\Delta$)*2 colors. We improve both the time and the number of colors simultaneously by showing an algorithm working in time O(log*(n/$\Delta$)) and using O($\Delta$) colors. This is the first known O($\Delta$)-vertex-coloring distributed algorithm which can work faster than in polylogarithmic time.

Our method also gives an edge-coloring algorithm with the number of colors and time as above. On the other hand, it follows from Linial [17] that our time of O($\Delta$)-coloring cannot be improved in general. In addition we show how our method gives fast coloring algorithms in communication models weaker than Linial's.},

	Abstract = { We conduct an experimental analysis of a distributed randomized algorithm for edge coloring simple undirected graphs. The algorithm is extremely simple yet, according to the probabilistic analysis, it computes nearly optimal colorings very quickly [Grable and Panconesi 1997]. We test the algorithm on a number of random as well as nonrandom graph families.The test cases were chosen based on two objectives: (i) to provide insights into the worst-case behavior (in terms of time and quality) of the algorithm and (ii) to test the performance of the algorithm with instances that are likely to arise in practice. Our main results include the following:(1) The empirical results obtained compare very well with the recent empirical results reported by other researchers [Durand et al. 1994, 1998; Jain and Werth 1995].(2) The empirical results confirm the bounds on the running time and the solution quality as claimed in the theoretical paper. Our results show that for certain classes of graphs the algorithm is likely to perform much better than the analysis suggests.(3) The results demonstrate that the algorithm might be well suited (from a theoretical as well as practical standpoint) for edge coloring graphs quickly and efficiently in a distributed setting.Based on our empirical study, we propose a simple modification of the original algorithm with substantially improved performance in practice.

	Annote = {This is the simplest possible algorithm for solving this problem in a distributed fashion. The algorithm consists of three steps. First, all uncolored edges choose a random color. Then all edges check for conflicts. Those that conflict release their color, those that do not become colored edges. This process is repeated until the algorithm runs out of colors or uncolored edges.

The authors test this algorithm as well as a modified version that can add colors to its palette, against several types of graphs. They find that the modified algorithm performs well overall. },

	Abstract = {This paper deals with the problems of computing a maximal independent set and a vertex coloring in a distributed model of computation. Given a connected graph G = (V, E) with IVI = n and maximum degree A such that G is neither a complete graph nor an odd cycle, Brooks' theorem shows that G can be colored with A colors. We generalize as follows: let G -- w be A-colored; then, v can be colored by considering the vertices in an O(loga n) radius around v, and this is tight. Using this, we show that A-coloring G is reducible in 0(log3 n/log A) time to (A+ I)-vertex coloring G in a distributed model. This leads to fast distributed algorithms, and a linear--processor NC algorithm, for A- coloring. We also prove a tight Q(diameter(G)) lower bound for A-edge-coloring bipartite graphs, even with unlimited randomness. When A = 2, this implies an Q(n) lower bound for vertex coloring paths and even cycles. 

A fundamental notion in distributed graph algorithms is that of a cluster decomposition, introduced by Awerbuch, Goldberg, Luby and Plotkin. We improve the existing bounds by showing how to compute a cluster decomposition in O(n''('('')) ) time, where e(n) = 1/=. This implies improved bounds for several problems, such as computing a maximal independent set and a (A + I )-coloring. We also show how to compute a A--coloring within the same time bound, using our reduction technique. Next, we show that the problem of doing better than O(n''('(m))) time for cluster decomposition is self-reducible to graphs of ``intermediate'' 
diameter and degree. This pinpoints the weak points of existing cluster decomposition algorithms. },

	Abstract = {A mobile ad hoc network is a collection of autonomous mobile nodes that communicate with each other over wireless links. Such networks are expected to play an increasingly important role in future civilian and military settings, being useful for providing communication support where no fixed infrastructure exists or the deployment of a fixed infrastructure is not economically profitable and movement of communicating parties is possible. However, since there is no stationary infrastructure such as base stations, mobile hosts need to operate as routers in order to maintain the information about the network connectivity. Therefore, a number of routing protocols have been proposed for ad hoc wireless networks. In this paper, we study and compare the performance of the following routing protocols AODV, PAODV (preemptive AODV), CBRP, DSR, and DSDV. A variety of workload and scenarios, as characterized by mobility, load and size of the ad hoc network were simulated. Our results indicate that despite its improvement in reducing route request packets, CBRP has a higher overhead than DSR because of its periodic hello messages while AODV's end-to-end packet delay is the shortest when compared to DSR and CBRP. PAODV has shown little improvements over AODV.},

	Abstract = {Early simulation experience with wireless ad hoc networks suggests that their capacity can be surprisingly low, due to the requirement that nodes forward each others' packets. The achievable capacity depends on network size, traffic patterns, and detailed local radio interactions. This paper examines these factors alone and in combination, using simulation and analysis from first principles. Our results include both specific constants and general scaling relationships helpful in understanding the limitations of wireless ad hoc networks.

We examine interactions of the 802.11 MAC and ad hoc forwarding and the effect on capacity for several simple configurations and traffic patterns. While 802.11 discovers reasonably good schedules, we nonetheless observe capacities markedly less than optimal for very simple chain and lattice networks with very regular traffic patterns. We validate some simulation results with experiments.

We also show that the traffic pattern determines whether an ad hoc network's per node capacity will scale to large networks. In particular, we show that for total capacity to scale up with network size the average distance between source and destination nodes must remain small as the network grows. Non-local traffic-patterns in which this average distance grows with the network size result in a rapid decrease of per node capacity. Thus the question ``Are large ad hoc networks feasible?'' reduces to a question about the likely locality of communication in such networks.},

	Abstract = {An ad hoc wireless network, or simply an ad hoc network, consists of a collection of geographically distributed nodes that communicate with one other over a wireless medium. An ad hoc network differs from cellular networks in that there is no wired infrastructure and the communication capabilities of the network are limited by the battery power of the network nodes. One of the original motivations for ad hoc networks is found in military applications. A classic example of ad hoc networking is network of war fighters and their mobile platforms in battlefields. Indeed, a wealth of early research in the area involved the development of packet-radio networks (PRNs) and survivable radio networks [16]. While military applications still dominate the research needs in ad hoc networking, the recent rapid advent of mobile telephony and plethora of personal digital assistants has brought to the fore a number of potential commercial applications of ad hoc networks. Examples are disaster relief, conferencing, home networking, sensor networks, personal area networks, and embedded computing applications [37].The lack of a fixed infrastructure in ad hoc networks implies that any computation on the network needs to be carried out in a decentralized manner. Thus, many of the important problems in ad hoc networking can be formulated as problems in distributed computing. However, there are certain characteristics of ad hoc networks that makes this study somewhat different than traditional work in distributed computing. In this article, we review some of the characteristic features of ad hoc networks, formulate problems and survey research work done in the area. We focus on two basic problem domains: topology control, the problem of computing and maintaining a connected topology among the network nodes, and routing. This article is not intended to be a comprehensive survey on ad hoc networking. The choice of the problems discussed in this article are somewhat biased by the research interests of the author.The remainder of this article is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe various aspects relevant to modeling ad hoc networks. In Section 3, we discuss topology control. Since the nodes of an ad hoc network are often associated with points in 2-dimensional space, topology control is closely tied to computational geometry; we will briefly review this relationship and extant work in the area. In Section 4, we discuss routing protocols for ad hoc networks. After a brief overview of the many protocols that have been proposed, we discuss alternative approaches based on the adversarial network model.},

	Abstract = {Multi-agent systems must be engineered to ensure that desirable system-level properties will consistently emerge from the complex interactions of the underlying agents, while also guaranteeing that undesirable behavior will be suppressed. We present an Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) framework for modeling, visualizing and manipulating emergent structure in multi-agent systems. By encapsulating the macroscopic structure, we can identify undesirable patterns of behavior at a higher level of abstraction. The identification of such patterns allows us to implement a feedback loop to steer the behavior of the lower level agents towards actions favorable for the emergence of a reliable solution. AOP facilitates the modeling of the system-wide behavior, thus it serves as a valuable tool for building confidence that a given multi-agent system will consistently meet its requirements.},

	Abstract = {Packet-scheduling is a particular challenge in wireless networks due to interference from nearby transmissions. A distance-2 interference model serves as a useful abstraction here, and we study packet routing and scheduling under this model. The main focus of our work is the development of fully-distributed (decentralized) protocols. We present polylogarithmic/constant factor approximation algorithms for various families of disk graphs (which capture the geometric nature of wireless-signal propagation), as well as near-optimal approximation algorithms for general graphs. The packet-scheduling work by L eighton, Maggs and Rao (Combinatorica, 1994) and a basic distributed coloring procedure, originally due to Luby (J. Computer and System Sciences, 1993), underlie many of our algorithms. Experimental work of Finocchi, Panconesi, and Silvestri (SODA 2002) showed that a natural modification of Luby's algorithm leads to improved performance, and a rigorous explanation of this was left as an open question; we prove that the modified algorithm is provably better in the worst-case. Finally, using simulations, we study the impact of the routing strategy and the choice of parameters on the performance of our distributed algorithm for unit disk graphs.},

	Abstract = {We propose a parameterized, randomized edge coloring algorithm for use in coordinating data transfers in fully connected distributed architectures such as parallel 1/0 subsystems and multimedia information systems. Our approach is to preschedule 1/0 requests to eliminate contention for 1/0 ports while maintaining an efficient use of bandwidth. Request scheduling is equivalent to edge coloring a bipartite graph representing pending 1/0 requests. Although efficient optimal algorithms exist for entralized edge coloring where the global request graph is known, in distributed architectures heuristics must be used. We propose such heuristics and use experimental analysis to determine their ability to approach the centralized optimal. The performance of our algorithms is also compared with the work of other researchers experimentally. Our results show that our algorithms produce schedules within 5% of the optimal schedule, a substantial improvement over existing algorithms. The use of experimental analysis allows us to evaluate the appropriateness of each heuristic for a variety of different architectural models and applications. },

	Abstract = {This paper investigates applications of heuristic techniques for solving the edge coloring problem, which seeks the minimum number of colors to color the edges of a graph such that no two adjacent edges (edges that share a common vertex) get the same color. Except for special cases, such as bipartite graphs, the edge coloring problem is NP-complete. Thus, the search for exact algorithms is replaced by the investigation of approximgttion and heuristic algorithms (unless P=NP). In this work, we consider both simple graphs and multigraphs, and compare three heuristics for the edge coloring problem. The first is a greedy algorithm, and the two others are genetic algorithms: a genetic algorithm that makes use of LibGA and a grouping genetic algorithm. Our results

	Abstract = {We conduct an experimental analysis of a distributed, randomized algorithm for edge coloring simple undirected graphs. The algorithm is extremely simple, yet, according to the probabilistic analysis, it computes nearly optimal colorings very quickly [12]. We test the algorithm on a number of random as well as non-random graph families. The test cases were chosen based on two objectives --- (i) to provide insights into the worst case behavior (in terms of time and quality) of the algorithm and (ii) to test the performance of the algorithm with instances that are likely to arise in practice. Our main results include the following: The empirical results obtained compare very well with the recent empirical results reported by other researchers [5, 6, 18]. The empirical confirm the bounds on the running time and the solution quality as claimed in the theoretical paper. Our results show that for certain classes of graphs the algorithm is likely to perform much better than the analysis suggests The results demonstrate that the algorithm might be well suited (from a theoretical as well as practical stand-point) for edge coloring graphs quickly and efficiently in a distributed setting. Based on our empirical study, we propose a simple modification of the original algorithm with substantially improved performance in practice.  },

	Abstract = {Background
Immunological prevention of cancer has been obtained in HER-2/neu transgenic mice using a vaccine that combines 3 different immune stimuli (Triplex vaccine) that is repeatedly administered for the entire lifespan of the host (Chronic protocol). Biological experiments leave open the question of whether the Chronic protocol is indeed the minimal vaccination schedule affording 100% protection, or whether shorter protocols could be applied that would result in the same efficacy. A biological solution would require an enormous number of experiments, each lasting at least one year. Therefore we approached this problem by developing a simulator (SimTriplex) which describes the immune response activated by Triplex vaccine. This simulator, tested against in vivo experiments on HER-2/neu mice, reproduces all the vaccination protocols used in the in vivo experiments. The simulator should describe any vaccination protocol within the tested range. A possible solution to the former open question using a minimal search strategy based on a genetic algorithm is presented. This is the first step toward a more general approach of biological or clinical constraints for the search of an effective vaccination schedule.

Results
The results suggest that the Chronic protocol included a good number of redundant vaccine administrations, and that maximal protection could still be obtained with a number of vaccinations ~40% less than with the Chronic protocol.

Conclusion
This approach may have important connotations with regard to translation of cancer immunopreventive approaches to human situations, in which it is desirable to minimize the number of vaccinations. We are currently setting up experiments in mice to test whether the actual effectiveness of the vaccination protocol agrees with the genetic algorithm.},

However, few negotiations quantify the consequences of alternatives solutions. Models that are used are often oversimplified and only take into account elements that are easy to calculate, or they are too complex to be used for negotiations in real time. In all cases, they do not consider the heterogeneity of decision makers. The authors demonstrate that agent-based modeling could help these negotiations by showing the consequences of water allocation rules with respect to different criteria.},

Moreover, visualization has a special role to play within artificial life as a result of the informal status of its key explananda: life and complexity. Both are poorly defined but apparently identifiable via raw inspection. Here we concentrate on how visualization techniques might allow us to move beyond this situation by facilitating increased understanding of the relationships between an ALife system's (low-level) composition and organization and its (high-level) behavior. We briefly review the use of visualization within artificial life, and point to some future developments represented by the articles collected within this special issue. },

These CAS algorithms are based on squirrel natural behaviors and provide a novel CAS metaphor. The CAS Squirrels system is described together with its associated class architecture. A comprehensive set of experiments is carried to corroborate our hypothesis that CAS Squirrel based algorithms provide a efficient resource allocation on a distributed system. The algorithms are based on squirrel hoarding mechanisms. The scalability and reliability obtained from the experiments are maintained across a wide variety of distributed system characteristics. The research work uses the Peer-to-Peer Distributed File System storage resource allocation problem to validate our hypothesis.

	Abstract = {In this paper we introduce a novel aspect oriented implementation language, called JAsCo. JAsCo is tailored for component based development and the Java Beans component model in particular. The JAsCo language introduces two concepts: aspect beans and connectors. An aspect bean describes behavior that interferes with the execution of a component by using a special kind of inner class, called a hook. The specification of a hook is context independent and therefore reusable. A connector on the other hand, is used for deploying one or more hooks within a specific context. To implement the JAsCo language, we propose a new "aspect-enabled' component model, which contains build-in traps that enable to interfere with the normal execution of a component. The JAsCo component model is backward-compatible with the Java Beans component model. Furthermore, the JAsCo component model allows very flexible aspect application, adaptation and removal at run-time. The necessary tool support for the JAsCo approach has been implemented. In addition, we present a performance assessment of our current implementation.},

	Abstract = { Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) is attracting attention from both research and industry, as illustrated by the ever-growing popularity of AspectJ, the de facto standard AOP extension of Java. From a compiler construction perspective AspectJ is interesting as it is a typical example of compositional language, ie a language composed of a number of separate languages with different syntactical styles: in addition to plain Java, AspectJ includes a language for defining pointcuts and one for defining advices. Language composition represents a non-trivial challenge for conventional parsing techniques. First, combining several languages with different lexical syntax leads to considerable complexity in the lexical states to processed. Second, as new language features for AOP are being explored, many research proposals are concerned with further extending the AspectJ language, resulting in a need for an extensible syntax definition.This paper shows how scannerless parsing elegantly addresses the issues encountered by conventional techniques when parsing AspectJ . We present the design of a modular, extensible, and formal definition of the lexical and context-free aspects of the AspectJ syntax in the Syntax Definition Formalism SDF, which is implemented by a scannerless, generalized-LR parser (SGLR). We introduce grammar mixins as a novel application of SDF's modularity features, which allows the declarative definition of different keyword policies and combination of extensions. We illustrate the modular extensibility of our definition with syntax extensions taken from current research on aspect languages. Finally, benchmarks show the reasonable performance of scannerless generalized-LR parsing for this grammar.

	Abstract = {In aspect-oriented programming, one can intercept events by writing patterns called pointcuts. The pointcut language of the most popular aspect-oriented programming language, AspectJ, allows the expression of highly complex properties of the static program structure.We present the first rigorous semantics of the AspectJ pointcut language, by translating static patterns into safe ( i.e. range-restricted and stratified) Datalog queries. Safe Datalog is a logic language like Prolog, but it does not have data structures; consequently it has a straightforward least fixpoint semantics and all queries terminate.The translation from pointcuts to safe Datalog consists of a set of simple conditional rewrite rules, implemented using the Stratego system. The resulting queries are themselves executable with the CodeQuest system. We present experiments indicating that direct execution of our semantics is not prohibitively expensive. },

	Abstract = { We define a generic join point model for checking the Law of Demeter (LoD). Join points are trees, pointcuts are predicates over join points, and advice is checked statically similar to how declare warning is checked in AspectJ. We illustrate how the joint point form is mapped to the object and class forms of LoD, and provide an implementation in AspectJ that approximates LoD's class form by dynamically checking a particular execution using only the join points' static part. The paper proposes two ways to extend AspectJ to provide access to lexical join points directly. The first proposes statically executable advice and pointcut designators over lexical join points. The second proposes statically executable meta-advice over the exposed abstract syntax tree of the program and using Demeter style traversals to mirror AspectJ pointcuts.

At the same time these systems are very complex and many concerns in the implementation of such systems are of highly crosscutting nature. The concept of aspect orientation can be applied to allow a modular implementation of these concerns. With AspectJ the first complete and powerful language extension for aspect-oriented programming (AOP) has been created. However, the costs of the Java run-time environment are not feasible for most embedded applications.This paper presents AspectC++ (Gal & Spinczyk 2001), a new language extension to C/C++ that provides powerful language elements to facilitate aspect-oriented programming even in domains with tight resource limitations.},

	Abstract = {Interest in teaching object-oriented programming in first year computer science courses has increased substantially over the last few years. While the theoretical advantages are clear, it is not obvious that the available object-oriented languages are suitable for this purpose. None of the existing languages is appropriate for teaching object-oriented principles. In this paper we discuss the requirements for an object-oriented teaching language and draw attention to the deficiencies of existing languages. In particular, the paper examines C++, Smalltalk, Eiffel and Sather. Finally we outline characteristics of a new language, specifically designed for teaching purposes.},

	Abstract = {In this paper we propose an extension to JAsCo for supporting Adaptive Programming in a Component-Based Software Development context. JAsCo is an aspect-oriented programming language targeted at Component-Based Software Development and allows encapsulating crosscutting concerns using highly reusable aspect beans. Adaptive Programming on the other hand, allows capturing crosscutting concerns by structure-shy adaptive visitors. We propose to implement an adaptive visitor as a regular JAsCo aspect bean. Hence, the reusability of an adaptive visitor is improved because the same visitor can be reused within different component contexts. We introduce JAsCo traversal connectors to deploy adaptive visitors, implemented as JAsCo aspect beans, upon a concrete component traversal. In addition, these traversal connectors allow to explicitly specify how the behavior of several adaptive visitors, instantiated onto the same component traversal, needs to be combined by making use of the JAsCo precedence and combination strategies. A prototype implementation of the JAsCo Adaptive Programming extension, which employs the DJ library, is available. As a proof of concept, we present an extended case study in the context of the Web Service Management Layer (WSML) project. In this case study, a set of visitors implemented in JAsCo is reused to accomplish multiple tasks.

	Abstract = { AspectJ is a well-established programming language for the implementation of aspect-oriented programs. It supports the aspect-oriented programming paradigm by providing a special unit, called "aspect", which encapsulates crosscutting code. While with AspectJ a suitable aspect-oriented programming language is at hand, no feasible modeling language is available that supports the design of AspectJ programs. In this work, such a design notation for AspectJ programs is presented based on the UML. It provides representations for all language constructs in AspectJ and specifies an UML implementation of AspectJ's weaving mechanism. The design notation eases the perception of aspect-orientation and AspectJ programs. It carries over the advantages of aspect-orientation to the design level.

	Abstract = { Traceability of requirements and concerns enhances the quality of software development. We use trace relations to define crosscutting. As starting point, we set up a dependency matrix to capture the relationship between elements at two levels, e.g. concerns and representations of concerns. The definition of crosscutting is formalized in terms of linear algebra, and represented with matrices and matrix operations. In this way, crosscutting can be clearly distinguished from scattering and tangling. We apply this approach to the identification of crosscutting across early phases in the software life cycle, based on the transitivity of trace relations. We describe an illustrative case study to demonstrate the applicability of the analysis.

	Abstract = {The domain of digital rights management (DRM) is currently lacking a generic architecture that supports interoperability and reuse of specific DRM technologies. This lack of architectural support is a serious drawback in light of the rapid evolution of a complex domain like DRM. It is highly unlikely that a single DRM technology or standard will be able to support the diversity of devices, users, platforms, and media, or the wide variety of system requirements concerning security, flexibility, and efficiency. This paper analyses state-of-the-art DRM technologies and extracts from them high level usage scenarios according to content consumers, producers, and publishers. In addition, the key services are identified both from a functional and security perspective. Identifying key DRM services and locating them in an overall structure brings us one step closer to a software architecture for DRM. Having available a software architecture should help the DRM community in reasoning about DRM systems, and in achieving reuse and interoperability of multiple domain-specific DRM technologies and standards.},

	Abstract = {Copyright Licences are the traditional way for authors to control software but Digital Rights Management (DRM) techniques are becoming increasingly used, especially since new laws to that effect are being adopted around the world. This is altering the delicate balance between the need for authors to obtain revenue from their software, and the need for the public to access and use this software. Ultimately, these two models seem to be in opposition. Instead of being seen as the continuation of copyright rules, DRM could be more appropriately described as a whole new kind of intellectual property.

	Abstract = { In the Foundation series, Asimov predicted a 1,000 years of darkness following the fall of the galactic empire. In the book Noir, K.W Jeter describes a world where IP is the ultimate war. Combine them together and you have likely scenario No. 1.The Internet era enabled communication and information exchange on a global scale. But it also opened the door to copyright infringement on a global scale. Music, books, movies, software, games, speeches, research papers - everything is now fair game. The only protection the movie studios ever had was bandwidth - and it is quickly evaporating due to faster network connectivity via broadband and smarter downloading technologies such as BitTorrent.Intellectual property, copyrights and the like are the key to a democratic, free-market civilization and greed is a prime mover - so if all is 'free' and we have a 'constitutional right' to 'share' - where is the future of innovation and creativity?This paper will describe the current state of the great IP war (early stages of border unrest and some commando activity), outline potential futures, and make some suggestions as to how to help direct the world toward a reasonable future.In each case, we will cover the business, legal, and social implications of the scenario and we will discuss the various ways the computing industry can help to influence the future outcome.

In order to examine the functions of copyright it is critical to examine the larger technological context of copyright: analog media and printed paper in particular. The copyright system includes both the explicit mechanisms implemented by law and the implicit mechanisms resulting from the technologically determinant features of paper and print. In order to prevent confusion between the legal, technical, and economic elements I refer to the whole as "copy accurate".Digital rights management design should explicitly address legal issue in copyright and economics of paper, technology of mass produced analog media, and print culture.

This paper describes an open architecture for digital rights management (DRM) enforcement on trusted computing platforms that empowers the consumer to select their operating-system and applications, including open-source options, without weakening the strength of the security functions. A key component in the architecture is a security manager that enforces mandatory access controls on shared devices, restricted information flows between virtual machines, and DRM policy on protected objects. The paper describes two use-cases: a DRM scenario with protected media content and remote home-working on sensitive medical data.},

	Abstract = {Robust technological enforcement of DRM licenses assumes that the prevention of direct access to the raw bit representation of decrypted digital content and the license enforcement mechanisms themselves is possible. This is difficult to achieve on an open computing platform such as a PC. Recent trusted computing initiatives namely, the Trusted Computing Group (TCG) specification, and Microsoft's Next Generation Secure Computing Base (NGSCB) aim in part to address this problem. The protection architecture and access control model of mainstream operating systems makes them inappropriate as a platform for a DRM content rendering client because decrypted content cannot be protected against a privileged process. If a DRM client is to be deployed on an open computing platform, the operating system should implement the reference monitor concept, which underpins the mandatory access control model. The TCG model of trusted computing has important limitations when combined with an operating system enforcing discretionary access control. We argue that the TCG services of sealed storage and remote attestation which are important in DRM applications, cannot operate in a secure and efficient manner on such an operating system.},

Since crosscutting concerns cannot be properly modularized within object-oriented programming, they are expressed as aspects and are composed, or woven, with traditionally encapsulated functionality referred to as components.Many AOP models exist, but their implementations are typically coupled with a single language. To allow weaving of existing components with aspects written in the language of choice, AOP requires a language-independent tool.},

	Abstract = { Object-oriented programming languages support encapsulation, thereby improving the ability of software to be reused, refined, tested, maintained, and extended. The full benefit of this support can only be realized if encapsulation is maximized during the design process. We argue that design practices which take a data-driven approach fail to maximize encapsulation because they focus too quickly on the implementation of objects. We propose an alternative object-oriented design method which takes a responsibility-driven approach. We show how such an approach can increase the encapsulation by deferring implementation issues until a later stage.

	Abstract = {Demeter/Java is an implementation of Adaptive Programming (AP) for Java. Demeter/Java programs consist of Java code together with programs in a small language to express traversals, visitor methods, and class diagrams. Demeter/Java programs are typically written in a preventive maintenance style using traversal strategies for expressing traversals. The resulting programs are very robust under changes to the class diagrams and visitors. This preventive maintenance style also leads to simpler programs, making both software development and maintenance easier. },

	Abstract = {Our initial ideas on preventive maintenance of object-oriented systems were presented in [LHR88] which describes a set of guidelines called the "Law of Demeter". As a result of this publication we have received much feedback, as well as a detailed critique from [Sak89]. In this paper we expand on the initial ideas and present a new perspective with which to view the Law. This perspective is based on client/supplier relationships between methods and classes and allows a cleaner description of the benefits of the Law. This paper is also a reply to [Sak89] which was pointing out that the formulation of the Law for C++ needs additional work.At first sight, the idea of any rules or principles being superimposed on the creative mind seems more likely to hinder than to help, but this is really quite untrue in practice. Disciplined thinking focusses inspiration rather than blinkers it.},

	Abstract = {Demeter{\texttrademark} is a system designed for the development of large software projects using a new software design methodology which focuses on growing rather than building software. We describe the software development process as one of growth and evolution as opposed to building and rebuilding because most complex objects in the real world are grown and not built. Since software design is obviously a complex process this new paradigm may be helpful in unraveling some of the problems associated with current software design practices. Demeter begins by providing an ideal environment for the sprouting and nurturing of a seed (data dictionary) into a plant (large scale software project). In addition, through the combined use of object-oriented programming technology, and parameterized classes, Demeter provides a facility for the reuse of software which was developed in previous software projects.},

With its growing popularity, practitioners and academics alike are wondering whether they should start looking into it, or otherwise risk having missed an important development. The author of this essay finds that much of aspect-oriented programming's success seems to be based on the conception that it improves both modularity and the structure of code, while in fact, it works against the primary purposes of the two, namely independent development and understandability of programs. Not seeing any way of fixing this situation, he thinks the success of aspect-oriented programming to be paradoxical.},

But it led to other problems. With thecurrent state of the art focused on Aspect-Oriented SoftwareDevelopment (AOSD), it is useful to revisit thegeneral objectives of the LoD and adapt it to the newideas. Hence we introduce the Law of Demeter for Concernsand discuss the important intersection of these approacheswith traversals. We explore the ramifications ofthe Laws of Demeter (LoD and LoDC) to achieve betterseparation of concerns through improved software processes.They are supported by language mechanisms thatare implemented using novel applications of automata theory.A revised version of this paper and the slides are availablefrom the Demeter website:http://www.ccs.neu.edu/research/demeterin the directory papers/icse-04-keynote/},

You tend to get the following related benefits when you follow the Law of Demeter while minimizing simultaneously code duplication, the number of method arguments and the number of methods per class: Easier software maintenance, less coupling between your methods, better information hiding, narrower interfaces, methods which are easier to reuse, and easier correct.ness proofs using structural induction. We discuss two important interpretations of the Law (strong and weak) and we prove that any object-oriented program can be transformed to satisfy the Law. We express the Law in several languages which support object-oriented programming, including Flavors, Smalltalk-80, CLOS,C++ and Eiffel.},

	Abstract = { The problem of coloring a graph with the minimum number of colors is well known to be NP-hard, even restricted to k-colorable graphs for constant k  3. This paper explores the approximation problem of coloring k-colorable graphs with as few additional colors as possible in polynomial time, with special focus on the case of k = 3. The previous best upper bound on the number of colors needed for coloring 3-colorable n-vertex graphs in polynomial time was on/logn  colors by Berger and Rompel, improving a bound of on  colors by Wigderson. This paper presents an algorithm to color any 3-colorable graph with on3/8polylog n  colors, thus breaking an ``O((n1/2-&ogr;(1)) barrier''. The algorithm given here is based on examining second-order neighborhoods of vertices, rather than just immediate neighborhoods of vertices as in previous approaches. We extend our results to improve the worst-case bounds for coloring k-colorable graphs for constant k > 3 as well.  },

	Abstract = {Abstract. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most frequent form of human genetic variation. They are of fundamental importance for a variety of applications including medical diagnostic and drug design. They also provide the highest--resolution genomic fingerprint for tracking disease genes. This paper is devoted to algorithmic problems related to computational SNPs validation based on genome assembly of diploid organisms. In diploid genomes, there are two copies of each chromosome. A description of the SNPs sequence information from one of the two chromosomes is called SNPs haplotype. The basic problem addressed here is the Haplotyping, i.e., given a set of SNPs prospects inferred from the assembly alignment of a genomic region of a chromosome, find the maximally consistent pair of SNPs haplotypes by removing data ``errors'' related to DNA sequencing errors, repeats, and paralogous recruitment. In this paper, we introduce several versions of the problem from a computational point of view. We show that the general SNPs Haplotyping Problem is NP--hard for mate--pairs assembly data, and design polynomial time algorithms for fragment assembly data. We give a network--flow based polynomial algorithm for the Minimum Fragment Removal Problem, and we show that the Minimum SNPs Removal problem amounts to finding the largest independent set in a weakly triangulated graph. },

	Abstract = {We present a simple I/O-efficient k-clustering algorithm that was designed with the goal of enabling a privacy-preserving version of the algorithm. Our experiments show that this algorithm produces cluster centers that are, on average, more accurate than the ones produced by the well known iterative k-means algorithm. We use our new algorithm as the basis for a communication-efficient privacy-preserving k-clustering protocol for databases that are horizontally partitioned between two parties. Unlike existing privacy-preserving protocols based on the k-means algorithm, this protocol does not reveal intermediate candidate cluster centers. },

	Abstract = {By making use of lexicographic breadth first search (Lex-BFS) and partition refinement with pivots, we obtain a very simple algorithms for some well-know problems in graph theory.
We give an O(n+mlogn) algorithm for transitive orientation of a comparability graph, and simple linear algorithms to recognize interval graphs, convex graphs, Y-semichordal graphs and matrices that have the consecutive-ones property.
Previous approaches to these problems used difficult preprocessing steps, such as computing PQ trees or modular decomposition. The algorithms we give are easy to understand and straightforward to prove. They do not make use of sophisticated data structures, and the complexity analysis is straightforward.},

	Abstract = {An  independent  set  of three  vertices  is called  an  asteroidal  triple  if between  every  two  vertices  in  the  triple  there  exists  a path  avoiding  the  neighbourhood  of the  third.  A  graph  is  asteroidal  triple-free  (AT-free,  for  short)  if  it  contains  no  asteroidal  triple.  A  classic  result  states  that  a  graph  is  an  interval  graph  if  and  only  if  it  is  chordal  and  AT-free.  Our  main  contribution  is  to  exhibit  a  very  simple,  linear-  time,  recognition  algorithm  for  interval  graphs  involving  four  sweeps  of the  well-known  Lexicographic  Breadth  First  Search.  Unlike  the  vast  majority  of  existing  algorithms,  we  do  not  use  maximal  cliques  in  our  algorithm  -  we  rely,  instead,  on  a  less  well-known  characterization  by  a  linear  order  of the  vertices. },

@article{7600487a,
	Abstract = {ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels couple cell metabolism to electrical activity by regulating K+ flux across the plasma membrane. Channel closure is mediated by ATP, which binds to the pore-forming subunit (Kir6.2). Here we use homology modelling and ligand docking to construct a model of the Kir6.2 tetramer and identify the ATP-binding site. The model is consistent with a large amount of functional data and was further tested by mutagenesis. Ligand binding occurs at the interface between two subunits. The phosphate tail of ATP interacts with R201 and K185 in the C-terminus of one subunit, and with R50 in the N-terminus of another; the N6 atom of the adenine ring interacts with E179 and R301 in the same subunit. Mutation of residues lining the binding pocket reduced ATP-dependent channel inhibition. The model also suggests that interactions between the C-terminus of one subunit and the 'slide helix' of the adjacent subunit may be involved in ATP-dependent gating. Consistent with a role in gating, mutations in the slide helix bias the intrinsic channel conformation towards the open state.},

	Abstract = { We consider the problem of determining which point sets in some given space realise a given distance multiset. Special cases include the ``turnpike problem'' where the points lie on a line, and the ``beltway problem'' where the points lie on a loop. Of interest is the algorithmic problem of determining such point sets for a given collection of distances and the combinatorial problem of finding bounds on the maximum number of different solutions. These problems find applications in many fields, including genetics and crystallography.In this paper, we give improved combinatorial bounds for the turnpike and baltway problems in both one and higher dimensions. We present a practical algorithm which, on n points drawn at random from a real interval, finds all solutions in &Ogr; (n2logn) time with probability 1. We also prove that some variants of the problem are NP-complete.  },

	Abstract = {In this study, we investigate self-organizing social hierarchies in multi-agent systems. Agents occupy the nodes of a small-world network and interact exclusively with other agents in their local neighbourhood. Here, the interactions represent competition for a limited resource. Monte-Carlo simulations show that the changes in a network's structure can alter the steady-state attributes for fixed reward/penalty mechanisms. The results suggest that the expected phase transition from a homogeneous to a hierarchical society depends on: (a) the relative strengths of the feedback mechanisms employed, (b) the underlying communication topology, and (c) whether previously dominated agents are replaced in the population by agents with higher social status. A key contribution of this paper is the coherent picture painted of the relationship between social differentiation and spatial structure in a multi-agent system.},

	Abstract = {Restricting network access of routing and packet forwarding to well-behaving nodes and denying access from misbehaving nodes are critical for the proper functioning of a mobile ad-hoc network where cooperation among all networking nodes is usually assumed. However, the lack of a network infrastructure, the dynamics of the network topology and node membership, and the potential attacks from inside the network by malicious and/or noncooperative selfish nodes make the conventional network access control mechanisms not applicable. We present URSA, a ubiquitous and robust access control solution for mobile ad hoc networks. URSA implements ticket certification services through multiple-node consensus and fully localized instantiation. It uses tickets to identify and grant network access to well-behaving nodes. In URSA, no single node monopolizes the access decision or is completely trusted. Instead, multiple nodes jointly monitor a local node and certify/revoke its ticket. Furthermore, URSA ticket certification services are fully localized into each node's neighborhood to ensure service ubiquity and resilience. Through analysis, simulations, and experiments, we show that our design effectively enforces access control in the highly dynamic, mobile ad hoc network.},

	Abstract = {In mobile ad hoc networks, nodes act both as terminals and information relays, and they participate in a common routing protocol, such as dynamic source routing (DSR). The network is vulnerable to routing misbehavior, due to faulty or malicious nodes. Misbehavior detection systems aim at removing this vulnerability. In this paper, we investigate the use of an artificial immune system (AIS) to detect node misbehavior in a mobile ad hoc network using DSR. The system is inspired by the natural immune system (IS) of vertebrates. Our goal is to build a system that, like its natural counterpart, automatically learns, and detects new misbehavior. We describe our solution for the classification task of the AIS; it employs negative selection and clonal selection, the algorithms for learning and adaptation used by the natural IS. We define how we map the natural IS concepts such as self, antigen, and antibody to a mobile ad hoc network and give the resulting algorithm for classifying nodes as misbehaving. We implemented the system in the network simulator Glomosim; we present detection results and discuss how the system parameters affect the performance of primary and secondary response. Further steps will extend the design by using an analogy to the innate system, danger signal, and memory cells.},

The simulations that can be done with our software package called SIMMUNE are based on immunological data that describe the behavior of immune system agents (cells, molecules) on a microscopial (i.e. agent-agent interaction) scale by defining cellular stimulus-response mechanisms. Since the behavior of the agents in SIMMUNE can be very flexibly configured, its application is not limited to immune system simulations. We outline the principles of SIMMUNE's multiscale analysis of emergent structure within the simulated immune system that allow the identification of immunological contexts using minimal a priori assumptions about the higher level organization of the immune system.},

	Abstract = { Athletes and coaches in most professional sports make use of high-tech equipment to analyze and, subsequently, improve the athlete's performance. High-speed video cameras are employed, for instance, to record the swing of a golf club or a tennis racket, the movement of the feet while running, and the body motion in apparatus gymnastics. High-tech and high-speed equipment, however, usually implies high-cost as well. In this paper, we present a passive optical approach to capture high-speed motion using multi-exposure images obtained with low-cost commodity still cameras and a stroboscope. The recorded motion remains completely undisturbed by the motion capture process. We apply our approach to capture the motion of hand and ball for a variety of baseball pitches and present algorithms to automatically track the position, velocity, rotation axis, and spin of the ball along its trajectory. To demonstrate the validity of our setup and algorithms, we analyze the consistency of our measurements with a physically based model that predicts the trajectory of a spinning baseball. Our approach can be applied to capture a wide variety of other high-speed objects and activities such as golfing, bowling, or tennis for visualization as well as analysis purposes.

	Abstract = {A model can be decomposed into components, then mapped onto a network of simulators for execution. With different levels of decompositions, we are interested in finding the optimal model decomposition that can be implemented on a particular structure of distributed simulators. This is done by comparing performance measures such as the minimum response time or the maximum throughout per unit of hardware complexity. We claim that the need for a model capable of performance evaluation is an important concern in designing distributed simulators. Thus a methodology for performance evaluation and simulation modelling of hierarchically specified distributed simulators is required. From the empirical results, we found that simulating a given distributed simulator model is suitable to get optimal performances, that is, each model has an optimal decomposition level in terms of performance. The influential performance measures are the average of simulation run times and the product of the average run time and the hardware complexity of the given simulator model.},

Suleyman Sevinc, University of Sydney , Australia

This tutorial has two purposes: to show how the features of CLOS affect a design and to describe the design of a general-purpose simulation system. The tutorial is designed for those who want to understand the practical importance of the unique features of CLOS and also those who would like to learn how to use or build object-oriented simulation systems.

The tutorial emphasizes the underlying model of object-oriented programming in CLOS and distinguishes it from other models. It also describes the requirements of a simulation system and the design of DEVS-CLOS, a publicly available simulation system. DEVS-CLOS is an extension to CLOS that supports modeling and simulation. It supports visualization, supports hierarchical design of simulations, allows first-order logic in models, and supports adaptive system simulation. The tutorial shows how a system like DEVS-CLOS can be used to solve typical simulation problems, and how CLOS concepts like multimethods, multiple inheritance, pre- and post-methods and dispatching algorithms were used in the design of DEVS-CLOS.

	Abstract = { This article describes a new priority queue implementation for managing the pending event set in discrete event simulation. Extensive empirical results demonstrate that it consistently outperforms other current popular candidates. This new implementation, called Ladder Queue, is also theoretically justified to have O(1) amortized access time complexity, as long as the mean jump parameter of the priority increment distribution is finite and greater than zero, regardless of its variance. Many practical priority increment distributions satisfy this condition including unbounded variance distributions like the Pareto distribution. This renders the LadderQ the ideal discrete event queue structure for stable O(1) performance even under practical queue distributions with infinite variance. Numerical simulations ranging from 100 to 10 million events affirm the O(1) property of LadderQ and that it is a superior structure for large-scale discrete event simulation.},

	Abstract = {Simulation models of large, complex ``real-world'' applications have occasionally earned the reputation of eating up hours of computer time. This problem may be attributed in part to difficulties such as slow stochastic convergence. However, an additional problem lies in the fact that a significant amount of bookkeeping time is required to keep future events in their proper sequence. This paper presents a method for significantly reducing the time spent scanning future events lists in discrete event simulations. Three models are presented, all of which improve in effectiveness as the events-list scan problem becomes more burdensome.},

	Abstract = { Simulation is a technique that can be viewed as all things to all people, It is surprising, sometimes even alarming, that so many diverse studies are carried on under the general term of 'simulation.' More disturbing is the fact that so little communications appears to exist between the practitioners in one area and those in another. "Man in the loop" simulations seem to be conducted without regard to the simulation of individual and group decision making behavior conducted by psychologists and sociologists. Techniques in Monte Carlo applications seem never to find acceptance, or perhaps awareness, in simulation of urban systems. The simulation of continuous systems exists as a totally separate entity from those working in the discrete event systems, and the effort of those seeking to bring the two together seem to offer little promise for immediate results. We suggest that the lack of communication among practitioners of simulation stems from the lack of a unifying structure or theory leading to an understanding and acceptance of the technique 'digital simulation.'},

The concepts of system and model, system state, entities, attributes and delays are defined in the general context of simulation. Using these concepts, event-scheduling, process-interaction, and activity-scanning perspectives are briefly described. To demonstrate the use of the concepts, a discrete system is modeled using the event-scheduling perspective. Simulation languages are classified in terms of the type of system being modeled, the application level, and the perspective taken. The features of a simulation language are discussed. Lastly, basic information is provided about an assortment of discrete-event simulation languages.},

While breve is conceptually similar to existing packages such as Swarm and StarLogo, the implementation of BREVE-which simulates both continuous time and continuous 3D space-is quite different such that the environment is suited to a different class of simulations. BREVE includes an interpreted object oriented language; an OpenGL display engine; collision detection; as well as experimental support for articulated body physical simulation and collision resolution with static and dynamic friction. The ultimate goal of the system is to allow decentralized simulations to be implemented quickly and easily while providing a powerful framework to facilitate the construction of advanced artificial life simulations.

	Abstract = {This paper analytically studies the performance of a synchronous conservative parallel discrete-event simulation protocol. The class of models considered simulates activity in a physical domain, and possesses a limited ability to predict future behavior. Using a stochastic model, it is shown that as the volume of simulation activity in the model increases relative to a fixed architecture, the complexity of the average per-event overhead due to synchronization, event list manipulation, lookahead calculations, and processor idle time approaches the complexity of the average per-event overhead of a serial simulation, sometimes rapidly. The method is therefore within a constant factor of optimal. The result holds for the worst case ``fully-connected'' communication topology, where an event in any other portion of the domain can cause an event in any other protion of the domain. Our analysis demonstrates that on large problems---those for which parallel processing is ideally suited--- there is often enough parallel workload so that processors are not usually idle. It also demonstrated the viability of the method empirically, showing how good performance is achieved on large problems using a thirty-two node Intel iPSC/2 distributed memory multiprocessor.},

	Abstract = { Compared to highly optimized optimistic simulators which use local event queues for individual processors on a shared-memory computer, we demonstrate that employing a single global event queue drastically reduces the number of rollbacks, brings down the storage requirements, and achieves superior load balance. On a bus-based Silicon Graphics multiprocessor, these virtues consistently translated into faster execution times and higher speedups on those synthetic networks of medium- to coarse-grained logical processes which were ridden with rollbacks and load imbalance on local-queue-based simulators. A dynamic randomization-based load distribution scheme for local-event-queue simulators is also shown to be an effective improvement.},

WarpIV is the next generation replacement for the Synchronous Parallel Environment for Emulation and Discrete Event Simulation (SPEEDES) framework that has supported a number of DoD simulation programs including MDWAR, EADTB, JSIMS, and others. This paper first provides a look back at the historical evolution of SPEEDES, the evolution of the SSA, and the development of WarpIV. This historical background is followed by a description of the layered SSA and design of WarpIV. Capabilities and new algorithms or data structures provided by each layer of the architecture are mentioned, but are not described in full detail. Several benchmarks for the underlying communications infrastructure and internal event-processing engine are given. The summary and conclusions section highlights the main technical points of the paper and describes future research and development goals for WarpIV.},

	Abstract = {Typically, large-scale optimistic parallel simulations will spend 90% or more of the total execution time forward processing events and very little time executing rollbacks. In fact, it was recently shown that a large-scale TCP model consisting of over 1 million nodes will execute without generating <i>any</i> rollbacks (i.e., perfect optimistic execution is achieved). The major cost involved in forward execution is the preparation for a rollback in the form of state-saving. Using a technique called <i>reverse computation</i>, state-saving overheads can be greatly reduced. Here, the rollback operation is realized by executing previously processed events in reverse. However, events are retained until GVT sweeps past. In this paper, we define a new algorithm for realizing a continuum of reverse computation-based parallel simulation systems, which enables us to relax the computing of GVT and potentially further reduces the amount of memory required to execute an optimistic simulation.},

	Abstract = { Optimistic computation methods typically save copies of objects' state information, so that they can recover from erroneous ``over-optimistic'' computations. Such state saving is generally time and space consuming, and can be rather complicated both to implement and to use.I show how the data structure community's theory of persistence can be used not only to analyse and explain the treatment of state in optimistic systems, but also as a simple yet general mechanism for performing the necessary state saving with minimal impact on application code.Preliminary results based on a benchmark application and an existing optimistic simulator are presented, showing that providing support for fully general object states is a realistic and practical option. In addition, I show how some existing state saving techniques---including support for shared state---can be derived, and discuss a number of ways in which the model might be extended.  },

	Abstract = {B cells are an important component of adaptive immunity. They produce and secrete millions of different antibody molecules, each of which recognizes a different (foreign) antigen. The fact that humans express a very large repertoire of antibodies is due to the complex mechanism of V(D)J recombination of immunoglobulin (Ig) genes as well as other processes including somatic hypermutation, gene conversion and class switching. The B cell receptor (BCR) is an integral membrane protein complex that is composed of two Ig heavy chains, two Ig light chains and two heterodimers of Ig{$[$}alpha{$]$} and Ig{$[$}beta{$]$}. To eliminate foreign antigens, B cells cooperate with other cells of the immune system including macrophages, dendritic cells and T cells. B cell development is a tightly controlled process in which over 75{\%} of the developing cells become apoptotic because of inappropriate immunoglobulin gene rearrangements or recognition of self antigens by Igs. Hence, the majority of B cell-associated disorders are caused by the incorrect function of genes/proteins involved in B cell development.},

	Abstract = {Artificial intelligence researchers have been attracted by the idea of having robots learn how to accomplish a task, rather than being told explicitly. Reinforcement learning has been proposed as an appealing framework to be used in controlling mobile agents. Robot learning research, as well as research in biological systems, face many similar problems in order to display high flexibility in performing a variety of tasks. In this work, the controlling of a vehicle in an avoidance task by a previously developed operant learning model (a form of animal learning) is studied. An environment in which a mobile robot with proximity sensors has to minimize the punishment for colliding against obstacles is simulated. The results were compared with the Q-Learning algorithm, and the proposed model had better performance. In this way a new artificial intelligence agent inspired by neurobiology, psychology, and ethology research is proposed.},

@article{590618,
	Abstract = { This article aims to show that linguistics, in particular the study of the lexico-syntactic aspects of language, provides fertile ground for artificial life modeling. A survey of the models that have been developed over the last decade and a half is presented to demonstrate that ALife techniques have a lot to offer an explanatory theory of language. It is argued that this is because much of the structure of language is determined by the interaction of three complex adaptive systems: learning, culture, and biological evolution. Computational simulation, informed by theoretical linguistics, is an appropriate response to the challenge of explaining real linguistic data in terms of the processes that underpin human language.

Our artificial life approach integrates motor, perceptual, behavioral, and cognitive components within a model of pedestrians as individuals. Our comprehensive model feature innovations in these components, as well as in their combination, yielding results of unprecedented fidelity and complexity for fully autonomous multi-human simulation in a large urban environment. We represent the environment using hierarchical data structures, which efficiently support the perceptual queries of the autonomous pedestrians that drive their behavioral responses and sustain their ability to plan their actions on local and global scales.},

Neuroscientists believe that much of this common sense involves predictive models for physical activities, but the transfer of sensorimotor skill knowledge to cognition is non-trivial, indicating that SEAI may meet a daunting challenge of its own. This paper considers the neurological basis for procedural common sense and the possibilities for its transfer to conscious reasoning. This helps assess the prospects for SEAI to eventually surpass classic AI in the quest for generally intelligence systems.},

	Abstract = {Cellular automata based models have proven capable of providing several new insights into the dynamics of the immune system (IS) response.A qualitative picture of the IS behavior can be obtained with small-scale simulations. However, for a more detailed analysis and to further validate the models, large-scale simulations are required.To this purpose we present here a simulator (PI) of the IS response which has been carefully designed and coded to allow such simulations (millions of cells with a very high degree of complexity). The code does not just resort to parallel processing to run faster. Data structures and I/O have been optimized as well to limit the (huge) memory and disk space requirements.The recent addition of the description of the T killer cellular mediated response allows the code to simulate both humoral and cellular immune reactions.All these features put PI among the most complete simulators of the immune system developed up today.},

Parallel heap is theoretically the first heap-based data structure to have implemented an optimally scalable parallel priority queue on an exclusive-read exclusive-write parallel random access machine. We compared it with Rao-and-Kumar's concurrent heap and with the conventional serial heap accessed via a lock. The parallel heap outperformed others for fine-to-medium grains achieving speedups of two to four using six processors relative to the best sequential execution times. The concurrent heap, however, exhibited performance comparable only to the serial heap. As expected for coarser grain, the serial heap performed at par with or better than others},

	Abstract = {The authors present parallel algorithms for heap operations on an EREW PRAM. They first present a parallel heap construction algorithm with <e1>p</e1> processors running in <e1>O</e1>(<e1>n</e1>/<e1>p</e1>+log<e1>p</e1>) time. It takes 3.625<e1>n</e1>/<e1>p</e1>+4log <e1>p</e1> time in the worst case. The algorithm is optimal when <e1>p</e1>=&thetas;(<e1>n</e1>/log<e1>n</e1>). They then propose a method to delete the root of a heap in parallel. To facilitate dynamic processor allocation, a data structure is developed in a preparatory step using <e1>O</e1>((<e1>n</e1>/log<e1>n</e1>)<sup>1-1/p</sup>) processors in <e1>O</e1>(log<e1>p</e1>) time. A sequence of root deletion operations is realized such that each of these operations takes <e1>O</e1>((log<e1>n</e1>)/<e1>p</e1>+log<e1>p</e1>+loglog<e1>n</e1>) time using <e1>p</e1> processors. The authors also suggest an <e1>O</e1>((log<e1>n</e1>)/<e1>p</e1>+log <e1>p</e1>) time optimal parallel insert algorithm using <e1>p</e1> processors. When <e1>p</e1>=&thetas;((log<e1>n</e1>)/loglog<e1>n</e1>), both algorithms run in <e1>O</e1>(loglog<e1>n</e1>) time.

	Abstract = {We describe a new parallel algorithm for discrete event simulation on exclusive-read exclusive-write parallel random-access machine (EREW PRAM). This algorithm is based on a recently developed parallel data structure, namely parallel heap, which when used as a parallel event-queue, allows deletion of O(p) earliest messages and insertion of o(p) new messages each in O(log n) time, using p processors, where n is the number of messages scheduled. Our algorithm can simulate up to p independent messages in O(log n) time - thus achieving O(p) speedup. The number of processors, p, can be optimally varied in the range 1 ~ p ~ n. To our knowledge, such a theoretical efficiency in a parallel simulation algorithm has been achieved for the first time. },

One interesting comparison between CORBA (a product of the Object Management Group), HLA (the Department of Defenses High Level Architecture) and RMI (a Java product) is that two of these systems, CORBA and HLA, are language neutral. The authors argue that language neutrality is best for large scale simulations, because it makes fewer assumptions about the platforms involved. However, the authors point out that a cost of legacy and cross compatibility can be security, as the RMI system is more secure than the other two.},

	Abstract = {Simulations are used extensively for studying artificial intelligence. However, the simulation technology in use by and designed for the artificial intelligence community often fails to take advantage of much of the work by the larger simulation community to produce distributed, repeatable, and efficient simulations. We present the new system known as <i>System for Parallel Agent Discrete Event Simulator, (SPADES)</i>, which is a simulation environment for the artificial intelligence community. <i>SPADES</i> focuses on the <i>agent</i> as a fundamental simulation component. The <i>thinking time</i> of an agent is tracked and reflected in the results of the agents' actions by using a <i>Software-in-the-Loop</i> mechanism. <i>SPADES</i> supports distributed execution of the agents across multiple systems, while at the same time producing repeatable results regardless of network or system load. We discuss the design of <i>SPADES</i> in detail and give experimental results. <i>SPADES</i> is flexible enough for a variety of application domains in the artificial intelligence research community.

	Abstract = {Internet worm spread is a phenomenon involving millions of hosts, who interact in complex and diverse environment. Scanning speed of each infected host depends on its resources and the defenses at work in its network. Aggressive worms further interact with the underlying Internet topology .. the dynamics of the spread is constrained by the limited bandwidth of network links, and high-volume scan traffic leads to BGP router failure thus affecting global routing. Worm traffic also interacts with legitimate background traffic competing for (and often winning) the limited bandwidth resources. To faithfully simulate worm spread and other Internet-wide events such as DDoS, flash crowds and spam we need a detailed Internet model, a packet-level simulation of relevant event features, and a realistic model of background traffic on the whole Internet. The memory and CPU requirements of such simulation exceed a single machines resources, creating a need for distributed simulation. We propose a design and present implementation of a distributed worm simulator, called PAWS. PAWS runs on Emulab testbed, which facilitates its use by other researchers. We validate PAWS in a variety of scenarios, and evaluate costs and benefits of distributed worm simulation.},

	Abstract = {Modeling and simulation permeate all areas of business, science and engineering. With the increase in the scale and complexity of simulations, large amounts of computational resources are required, and provisioning of the services is becoming increasingly difficult. The Grid provides a platform for coordinated resource sharing and application development and execution. In this paper, we focus on extending the High Level Architecture (HLA) to the Grid. More specifically, we propose a distributed simulation framework, called HLAGrid. The framework uses a Federate-Proxy-RTI architecture, which allows resources on the Grid to be utilized on demand by using Grid services. The architecture also supports federation discovery, security of the simulator logic, and flexible federation construction, such as hierarchical federations. The architecture hides the heterogeneity of the simulators, simulators execution platforms, and how the simulators communicate with the RTI. All interfaces used in the framework comply with the standard HLA interface specification, which provides reusability to simulators. A prototype of the framework is implemented using DMSOs RTI 1.3NG version 6 and the Grid system runs the Globus Toolkit.},

	Abstract = { We describe two major developments in the General Network Simulation Integration System (Genesis): the supportfor BGP protocol in large network simulations and distributionof the simulation memory among Genesis componentsimulations.Genesis uses a high granularity synchronization mechanismbetween parallel simulations simulating parts of a network.This mechanism uses checkpointed simulation stateto iterate over the same time interval until convergence.It also replaces individual packet data for flows crossingthe network partitions with statistical characterization ofsuch flows over the synchronization time interval. We hadachieved significant performance improvement over the sequential simulation for simulations with TCP and UDP traffic. However, this approach can not be used directly to simulatedynamic routing protocols that use underlying networkfor exchanging protocol information, as no packets are exchangedin Genesis between simulated network parts. Wehave developed a new mechanism to exchange and synchronizeBGP routing data among distributed Genesis simulators.The extended Genesis allows simulations of more realisticnetwork scenarios, including routing flows, in additionto TCP or UDP data traffic.Large memory size required by simulation software hindersthe simulation of large-scale networks. Based on ournew support of distributed BGP simulation, we developedan approach to construct and simulate networks on distributedmemory using Genesis simulators in such a way that each participating processor possesses only data relatedto the part of the network it simulates. This solutionsupports simulations of large-scale networks on machineswith modest memory size.

The primary results are (i) the design of an optimistic simulation algorithm, namely <i>SyncSim</i>, which does not rely on traditional state and message saving data structures, but employs only one backup state per state variable, (ii) a demonstration, through implementation of <i>SyncSim</i>, of an optimistic technique which overcomes the two main mutually conflicting and unbounded overheads of the existing optimistic simulation algorithms: <i>SyncSim</i> bounds the additional space requirements to just one copy per state variable and drastically limits the number of rollbacks encountered. Furthermore, <i>SyncSim</i> beats the highly optimized traditional simulator <i>simglobal</i> on a wide variety of large networks on an Origin-2000 computer. The algorithm <i>SyncSim</i> could form a basis for a good parallelizing engine attachable relatively easily to an existing serial simulator.},

	Abstract = {An overview of technologies concerned with distributing the execution of simulation programs across multiple processors is presented. Here, particular emphasis is placed on discrete event simulations. The High Level Architecture (HLA) developed by the Department of Defense in the United States is first described to provide a concrete example of a contemporary approach to distributed simulation. The remainder of this paper is focused on time management, a central issue concerning the synchronization of computations on different processors. Time management algorithms broadly fall into two categories, termed conservative and optimistic synchronization. A survey of both conservative and optimistic algorithms is presented focusing on fundamental principles and mechanisms. Finally, time management in the HLA is discussed as a means to illustrate how this standard supports both approaches to synchronization.},
	Annote = {Fujimoto assesses the state of parallel discrete event simulation in 2003, focusing exclusively on the High Level Architecture from the Department of Defense. There is a fairly brief overview of this technology, and unsatisfactory definitions of some key terms such as ``federate'' and ``federation''. The bulk of the paper concerns time management strategies. Fujimoto points out that the HLA can be used for both conservative and optimistic event simulation, and details the time management techniques for accomplishing this and the methodologies employed to avoid deadlock. Some attention is given at the end of the paper to work in using HLA to parallelize existing serial code.},

	Abstract = {Time-parallel simulation offers the potential of massive parallelization of a simulation application, due to the amount of achievable parallelism not being restricted by the decomposability of the state space of a simulation model. Unfortunately, the potential speedup of a time-parallel simulation highly depends on the ability to match final and initial states of adjacent time intervals. Depending on the properties of the underlying simulation model, it might be feasible to accept a simulation iteration, even if the states of adjacent time intervals do not match exactly. This leads to the concept of approximative state matching in time-parallel simulation, which is introduced in this paper. Experiments with a prototypical implementation of a simple simulation model show encouraging results in terms of simulation speedup and introduced error.},

	Abstract = {Efficient computer simulation of complex physical phenomena has long been challenging due to their multi-physics and multi-scale nature. In contrast to traditional time-stepped execution methods, we describe an approach using optimistic parallel discrete event simulation (PDES) and reverse computation techniques. We show that reverse computation-based optimistic parallel execution can significantly reduce the execution time of a plasma simulation without requiring a significant amount of additional memory compared to conservative execution techniques. We describe an application-level reverse computation technique that is efficient and suitable for complex scientific simulations involving floating point operations.},

Building on earlier work, they show that their system can, if rollback is reversed and the grain of the simulation is fine enough, present good speedup vs. sequential with little or no loss of accuracy. Some sources of concern are the need to use a special reversible random number generator and the need to limit the optimism of the system greatly to avoid multiple state rollbacks.},

	Abstract = {A novel micro-kernel approach to building parallel/distributed simulation systems is presented. Using this approach, a unified system architecture is developed for incorporating multiple types of simulation processes. The processes hold potential to employ a variety of synchronization mechanisms, and could even alter their choice of mechanism dynamically. Supported mechanisms include traditional lookahead-based conservative and state saving-based optimistic execution approaches. Also supported are newer mechanisms such as reverse computation-based optimistic execution and aggregation-based event processing, all within a single parsimonious application programming interface. The internal implementation and a preliminary performance evaluation of this interface are presented in $\mu$sik, which is an efficient parallel/distributed realization of the micro-kernel architecture in C++.},

Scalability is well demonstrated by the authors testing, but there is no comparative testing of $\mu$sik versus other models.},

Formal representation of simulation models can contribute to a number of aspects in the modeling and simulation enterprise. Separation of models from simulation execution engines is a prerequisite transferring model among phases of a project as well as from project to project. The Discrete Event System Specification (DEVS) formalism, drawing on its system theoretic basis, provides a number of important properties such as hierarchical, modular composition, universality and uniqueness that can support development of simulation models and environments their development. An layered architecture for supporting comprehensive M&S environments is discussed that unifies the theoretical framework with implementation in distributed computational environments.

	Abstract = {DEVS (Discrete Event System Specification) is a general modelling formalism with sound semantics founded on a system theoretic basis. This gives it a claim to be universal for formalisms describing Discrete Event Dynamic Systems (DEDS). This means that any other formalism such as Petri nets, which have become very popular for DEDS control can be embedded in it. Moreover, DEVS extends to the continuous case thus facilitating combined discrete/continuous modelling. The universality of DEVS is significant because it has been implemented in a variety of simulation environments, as extensions of diverse underlying Object-Oriented languages such aS CLOS and C++. This gives it not only the power of formal rigor but also the practical capability of application to real world complex systems. The DEVS formalism has associated with it a characteristic abstract simulation engine architecture that can be realized in diverse sequential and parallel/distributed platforms. It is especially suitable for the simulation study of complex technical and natural systems with intelligent components and for long term model development capability acquired through systematic reusability. This tutorial will present the basic concepts of the DEVS formalism and its associated simulation methodology. These concepts will be illustrated in the context of large scale ecosystems modelling.},

	Abstract = {Conventional computer modeling and simulation have focused on computer objects that represent elements of the real world. In this paper we present a new approach to modeling and simulation in which authors describe the characteristics of the world being simulated without specifying how they are to be represented as computer objects. This approach is enabled by the EASEL modeling and simulation system (EMSS). Furthermore, this approach does not assume global visibility and centralized control, which are inherently inaccurate assumptions for unbounded systems (in which participants have incomplete or imprecise information about the system as a whole). Because this approach allows models to be one-to-one with the real world, models should be more accurate and simulations more realistic. The discussion includes the challenges faced in the modeling and simulation process of the distance vector IP routing protocol over a large-scale communications network, and the language features intended to address these problems.

Once a problem has been identified, a well-established series of steps for attacking a simulation problem should be followed.  The first half of the discussion will focus on identifying applications, to help identify the problems amenable to solution by simulation.  Specifically, a description of applications in the following two major categories is provided:  (1) ``analytic'' decisions with uncertain components; and (2) comparison of alternative systems for determining resource or scheduling requirements.  The second half of the discussion will include recommendations for some of the steps in conducting a healthcare simulation project, including model building; data collection, setting assumptions, and documentation; validation; reporting results; and implementation.},

	Abstract = {The paper describes an approach for modeling complex systems by hiding as much formal details as possible from the user, still allowing verification and simulation of the model. The interface is based on UML to make the environment available to the largest audience. To carry out analysis, verification and simulation we automatically extract process algebras specifications from UML models. The results of the analysis is then reflected back in the UML model by annotating diagrams. The formal model includes stochastic information to handle quantitative parameters. We present here the stochastic ?-calculus and we discuss the implementation of its probabilistic support that allows simulation of processes. We exploit the benefits of our approach in two applicative domains: global computing and systems biology.},

This community is beginning to look at alternatives to traditional representations such as those provided by ordinary differential equations (ODE). Making use of the object-oriented (OO) paradigm, the Unified Modeling Language (UML) and Real-time Object-Oriented Modeling (ROOM) visual formalisms, we describe a simple model that includes membranes with lipid bilayers, multiple compartments including a variable number of mitochondria, substrate molecules, enzymes with reaction rules, and metabolic pathways. We demonstrate the validation of the model by comparison with Gepasi and comment on the reusability of model components.

	Abstract = {We investigate the universal characteristics of the simulated time horizon of the basic conservative parallel algorithm when implemented on regular lattices. This technique [1, 2] is generically applicable to various physical, biological, or chemical systems where the underlying dynamics is asynchronous. Employing direct simulations, and using standard tools and the concept of dynamic scaling from non-equilibrium surface/interface physics, we identify the universality class of the time horizon and determine its implications for the asymptotic scalability of the basic conservative scheme. Our main finding is that while the simulation converges to an asymptotic nonzero rate of progress, the statistical width of the time horizon diverges with the number of PEs in a power law fashion. This is in contrast with the findings of Ref. [3]. This information can be very useful, e.g., we utilize it to understand optimizing the size of a moving "time window" to enforce memory constraints.},

They find that they can scale simulations to an arbitrary size, however, there is a divergence that occurs in between the slowest and fastest event.

This can in some ways be alliviated by keeping events in a particular window, but it may be that scalability is lost by doing so. Interesting theoretical work.},

@article{84545,
	Abstract = { Parallel discrete event simulation (PDES), sometimes called distributed simulation, refers to the execution of a single discrete event simulation program on a parallel computer. PDES has attracted a considerable amount of interest in recent years. From a pragmatic standpoint, this interest arises from the fact that large simulations in engineering, computer science, economics, and military applications, to mention a few, consume enormous amounts of time on sequential machines. From an academic point of view, parallel simulation is interesting because it represents a problem domain that often contains substantial amounts of parallelism (e.g., see [59]), yet paradoxically, is surprisingly difficult to parallelize in practice. A sufficiently general solution to the PDES problem may lead to new insights in parallel computation as a whole. Historically, the irregular, data-dependent nature of PDES programs has identified it as an application where vectorization techniques using supercomputer hardware provide little benefit [14].A discrete event simulation model assumes the system being simulated only changes state at discrete points in simulated time. The simulation model jumps from one state to another upon the occurrence of an event. For example, a simulator of a store-and-forward communication network might include state variables to indicate the length of message queues, the status of communication links (busy or idle), etc. Typical events might include arrival of a message at some node in the network, forwarding a message to another network node, component failures, etc.We are especially concerned with the simulation of asynchronous systems where events are not synchronized by a global clock, but rather, occur at irregular time intervals. For these systems, few simulator events occur at any single point in simulated time; therefore parallelization techniques based on lock-step execution using a global simulation clock perform poorly or require assumptions in the timing model that may compromise the fidelity of the simulation. Concurrent execution of events at different points in simulated time is required, but as we shall soon see, this introduces interesting synchronization problems that are at the heart of the PDES problem.This article deals with the execution of a simulation program on a parallel computer by decomposing the simulation application into a set of concurrently executing processes. For completeness, we conclude this section by mentioning other approaches to exploiting parallelism in simulation problems.Comfort and Shepard et al. have proposed using dedicated functional units to implement specific sequential simulation functions, (e.g., event list manipulation and random number generation [20, 23, 47]). This method can provide only a limited amount of speedup, however. Zhang, Zeigler, and Concepcion use the hierarchical decomposition of the simulation model to allow an event consisting of several subevents to be processed concurrently [21, 98]. A third alternative is to execute independent, sequential simulation programs on different processors [11, 39]. This replicated trials approach is useful if the simulation is largely stochastic and one is performing long simulation runs to reduce variance, or if one is attempting to simulate a specific simulation problem across a large number of different parameter settings. However, one drawback with this approach is that each processor must contain sufficient memory to hold the entire simulation. Furthermore, this approach is less suitable in a design environment where results of one experiment are used to determine the experiment that should be performed next because one must wait for a sequential execution to be completed before results are obtained.

	Abstract = { Biopathway databases have been developed, such as KEGG and EcoCyc, that compile interaction structures of biopathways together with biological annotations. However, these biopathways are not directly editable and simulatable. Thus, we have made an application, the Biopathway Executer (BPE), that reconstructs these two major biopathway databases to XML formats of modeling and simulation platforms. BPE is developed with JAVA and has a database of executable biopathways that integrates some parts of biopathway information, KEGG and BioCyc, and other databases, e.g. MIPS and BRENDA. Currently, BPE employs the XML format (GONML) of a Hybrid Functional Petri net (HFPN) for the output. The features of HFPN are: (i) biopathways that contain discrete and continuous processes can be modeled, (ii) all biopathways that are modeled with ordinary differential equations (ODEs) can be remodeled, (iii) biopathways can be modeled while keeping readability by human. Other XML formats of biopathways, SBML and CellML are subsets of GONML. Thus, BPE can bridge major biopathway databases and major modeling and simulating softwares. To demonstrate the effectiveness/usability of BPE, four examples are created and simulated on Genomic Object Net which is based on the HFPN architecture; (i) executable KEGG maps while keeping the features of original maps, (ii) executable BioCyc maps while keeping the features of original maps, (iii) large-scale editable and simulatable KEGG metabolic pathways, (iv) a metabolic pathway with gene regulatory networks. These examples show that BPE is a useful tool for integrating biopathway databases for largescale modeling and simulation.},

	Abstract = { In developing the graphics computer system BIOMOD, we were concerned primarily with the user-system interface. Rather than developing a formal higher-level language specific to modeling in biology, it appeared more fruitful to examine empirically the activities of the modeling process, and to attempt to design so that these activities would be simple to perform. Unfortunately, however, it still functioned easily only for chemists, mathematicians, and programmers; a biologist would still not write FORTRAN or differential equations to describe the basic functions---for example, a neuron---of his problem. We would like, therefore, to describe a set of basic biological functions, or primitives, which can have unambiguous definitions and can be parameterized as required in a straightforward, clear way so that they can be called from the library and used in a new problem context. An extension of this concept is to prepare programmed modules, such as a capillary resistance bed, or models, such as a model of the four-chambered heart as a pump, which could be used as required. However, these latter modeling units are not easily parameterized and are usually too individually stylized to carry over from model to model. Instead, we have been concerned with more basic units which can be standardized, as will be described in subsequent sections of this paper. We first briefly describe the BIOMOD system itself.

The enhanced CellAK architecture consists of a network of active objects (polymers), each of which has behavior that causally depends partly on its own fine-grained structure (monomers), where this structure is constantly changing through interaction with other active objects.

	Abstract = {The simulation of large systems of biochemical reactions is a key part of research into molecular signaling and information processing in biological cells. However, it can be impractical because many relevant reactions are modeled as stochastic, discrete event processes, and the complexity of the computing task scales with the number of discrete events in a simulation. Traditionally, such simulations are computed on general purpose CPUs, and sometimes in networks of such processors. We show that an alternative algorithm to the conventional approaches based on the Gillespie algorithm reveals a fine-grained parallel structure that is amenable to realization in FPGA hardware. A method is shown for compiling biochemical reaction systems into corresponding Verilog descriptions of simulators that employ this alternative algorithm. We describe a preliminary implementation of such a compiled accelerator that demonstrates the performance of this approach, achieving an initial performance that is 20 times faster than a competing general purpose CPU.},

	Abstract = { The use of simulation techniques to develop schedules for chemotherapy of solid tumors is discussed. In recent years the Gompertz model has been verified as an accurate model of tumor cell growth. Interest in describing the growth of cell systems has resulted in the development of generalized cell growth simulation systems, enabling models of cell growth, cell kills and reaction to different stimuli to be simulated.This paper discusses the development of GOMPSIM, a hybrid system based on one such cell growth simulation system, CELLSIM, and an algorithm that fits actual tumor growth data to the Gompertz model. GOMPSIM modifies the CELLSIM parameters in successive trials until the simulated cell growth matches the Gompertz description of the tumor growth. Once the CELLSIM parameters describing the actual tumor growth are determined, the model created by these parameters is used to determine if effective chemotherapy is possible by simulating "cell kills" similar to events resulting from administering a drug. By observing the simulated reaction of the tumor (continued growth, attrition,...), it is hoped that a better understanding of cell kinetics and ultimately an effective drug treatment program can be determined.},

	Abstract = {We apply the multi-agent system (MAS) platform to the task of biological network simulation. In this paper, we describe the simulation of signal transduction (ST) networks using the DECAF [9] MAS architecture. Unlike previous approaches that relied on systems of differential equations (DE), the distributed framework of MAS scales well and allows us to model large, highly interconnected ST pathways. This scalability is achieved by adopting a hybrid strategy that factors macro-level measures, such as reaction rateconstants, to calculate the stochastic kinetics at the level of individual molecules. Thus, by capturing the ST domain at an intermediate level of abstraction, we are able to retain much of the granularity afforded by a purely individual-based approach. The task distribution within a MAS enables us to model certain physical properies, such as diffusion and subcellular compartmentalization, which have proven to be difficult for DE systems. We demonstrate that large-grained agents are well suited to maintaining interal state representations and efficient in computing reactant concentration, both of which are vital considerations in modeling the ST domain. In our system, a molecular species is modeled as an individual agent with hierarchical task network structures to represent self- and externally-initiated reactions. An agent's identity is determined by a rule file (one for every participating molecular species) that specifies the reactions it may participate in, as well as its initial concentration. Reactions within the system are actuated by inter-agent communication. We present results from modeling the well-studied epidermal growth factor (EGF) pathway, demonstrating the viability of MAS technologies as a simulation platform for biological networks.},

	Abstract = {Generalized geometric programming (GGP) is an optimization method in which the objective function and constraints are nonconvex functions. Thus, a GGP problem includes multiple local optima in its solution space. When using conventional nonlinear programming methods to solve a GGP problem, local optimum may be found, or the procedure may be mathematically tedious. To find the global optimum of a GGP problem, a bio-immune-based approach is considered. This study presents an artificial immune system (AIS) including: an operator to control the number of antigen-specific antibodies based on an idiotypic network hypothesis; an editing operator of receptor with a Cauchy distributed random number, and a bone marrow operator used to generate diverse antibodies. The AIS method was tested with a set of published GGP problems, and their solutions were compared with the known global GGP solutions. The testing results show that the proposed approach potentially converges to the global solutions.},

	Abstract = {Drug development is a complex and extremely risky process. It involves developing knowledge of the relevant biology at a variety of levels of detail in order to piece together a coherent model of the disease process and the potential point(s) of intervention. Ultimately, this model must be complete enough to support the prediction of effects and the explanation of clinical trial results. Unfortunately, such models of a disease process
have been primarily developed and maintained in human minds. Consequently, such models are limited by a human's ability to store all of the needed information,
structure it properly, and reason about its consequences involving both complex feedback and time dependencies. The following paper describes a knowledge-centered
approach to the development of biological models that support the drug development process. This technique focuses on a multi-level, hierarchical approach that
models various levels of the related biology using appropriate representation techniques based on both the type and availability of the knowledge.},

	Abstract = {The paper discusses the design and implementation of LiSEB, a class-based language built on top of APL2 to respond to challenges posed by modelling living systems from a medical point of view. LiSEB capitalises on several features of APL and on some lessons learned from its history. Living systems are modelled as open systems: environments in which concurrent mobile autonomous agents interact. Modelling of these properties required extensions of traditional object-oriented paradigms and of their previous translations under APL: a) every object performs a sequence of actions dynamically modified to adapt to circumstances; b) a new policy of message management is introduced uniformly encompassing broadcast and directly addressed communication. An example of a simulation using LiSEB illustrates these concepts.},

	Abstract = {Increasingly, biology researchers and medical practitioners are using computational tools to model and analyze dynamic systems across scales from the macro to the cellular to the biochemical level. We are using Information-Rich Virtual Environments (IRVEs) to display the results of biological simulations, and to allow users to interact with those simulations. While simulation architectures, algorithms, and processing power have enjoyed continuous optimization to date, the user interfaces to these applications have not. The problems of designing such IRVE interfaces arise from the requirement that a variety of spatial and abstract information must be integrated into one coherent experience for the user. This paper explores the design and development issues encountered in our implementation of a bioinformatics application, PathSim (Pathogen Simulation). Specifically, we describe the information and interaction issues in building a front-end tool to visually analyze the results of an agent-based immunology simulation. Finally, we present custom scenegraph objects and consider candidate functionality for future standards components.},

	Abstract = {Researchers of HIV-1 are today, still unable to determine exactly the biological mechanisms that cause AIDS. Various mechanisms have been hypothesized and their existences have been experimentally verified, but whether they are sufficient to account for the observed disease progression is still in question. To better understand the phenomena, HIV-1 researchers turn to scientific models for hypothesis verification. Modeling methods which rely on differential calculus to describe population dynamics, can be inconvenient for predicting nonuniform interactions on a spatial dimension. Multi-Agent (or MA) modeling approaches, on the other hand, views the immune system as a hierarchical structure of cooperating and competing agents, operating with highly coupled behaviours to exhibit emergent complexity. We adopt the latter approach to simulate the pathogenesis of HIV-1. We show the model design and the emergent results for four well-known hypotheses: Direct Effect on CD4+ cells, Rapid Viral Mutation, Syncytium Formation, and Filling of CD4+ Receptor sites under the influence of a null model for an adaptive response to HIV-1. We give the logical basis for our methodology and clarify the semantics for 'model accuracy'. Preliminary simulation results indicate that AIDS is more likely to be caused by either Rapid Viral Mutation or Syncytium Formation.},

The qualitative matching is defined as a homology condition between two dynamical systems. Five definitions and four theorems establish the basis for a procedure for the construction of continuous analogs which are defined by first-order differential equations, thus embedding the discrete system into a continuous one. The proposed approach is demonstrated by applying a model of generalized immune response to cognitive habit release mechanisms involved in phobia},

to determine which proteins are capable of interacting with one another

are created using digital confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. A
variety of visualization approaches are then used to examine the
interactions. These include volume rendering, isosurface extraction, and

	Abstract = {We believe that organism's defences have gradually evolved into a
real cognitive system after cell membrane receptors underwent
diversification in early fish, some 300 million years ago. The somatic
repertoires grow by combinatorial power, as receptors are assembled from
germ line information, by an aleatory and error prone process. There is
no doubt that a cellular automaton is well suited as the vehicle for
modeling these aspects of the immune response. In its simplest form, the
model consists of a 15x15 bidimensional grid, containing different
cell types, each expressing receptors in a form of 8-bit binary strings.
Antigens and antibodies interact if they meet within a site and if the
respective bits are complementary. The rules and cell programs are drawn
with a keen eye to current biological consensus, and the model behaves
like an immune system. We review the principle and the achievements of
the IMMSIM model and present preliminary results of the combined
cellular and humoral responses to a viral infection.},

	Abstract = {The immune system of vertebrates is generally viewed as a
prototype of a highly adaptive, distributed detection system, that
identifies and neutralizes pathogenic intrusions. The immune receptors
(antibodies) are able to bind to pathogens that they have not been
&ldquo;trained&rdquo; to recognize. This anticipatory capability is
thought to be due to a broad coverage of the pathogen space realized by
the antibodies that the immune system can produce. We attempt to explain
how this this coverage is achieved, given that the immune system uses a
relatively small number of genes to construct its receptors. We use an
evolutionary algorithm to explore the strategies that the antibody
libraries may evolve in order to encode pathogen sets of various sizes.
We derive a lower and upper bounds on the performance of the evolved
antibody libraries as a function of their size and the length of the
pathogen string. We also provide some insights in the strategy of the
antibody libraries. We discuss the implications of our results for
biological evolution of antibody libraries},

	Abstract = {Biological cells in mammalian immune systems use groups of
molecules to process signals for the purposes of detecting and
eliminating pathogens from the body. Immunologists strive to understand
the key molecular components of these living detectors. The size and
complexity of cells makes detailed, quantitative data very difficult to
collect. One approach to modeling with limited quantitative data is to
assume that the system is optimal (e.g., due to natural selection) for
the function it performs. In our work, we apply this approach to an
extended, stochastic version of McKeithan's (1995) model for T-cell
signal transduction. This model is interpreted as a binary detector on
which we impose mutual information as the optimality criterion. With a
model structure, a performance metric, and an optimization algorithm, we
then estimate the parameters of a molecular signal processing
model},

	Abstract = {The construction of reliable reactive systems is considered to be one of the most challenging goals in the fields of software and system engineering. The definition of a reactive system suits biological systems at different levels, ranging from gene networks, developing embryos and the immune system. We report here the application of a tool developed for constructing computerized systems to the modeling and analysis of a biological system, the immune system. We use the language of statecharts within the framework of object-oriented modeling. The results described here indicate that this modeling strategy can contribute to the transition of biology from the phase of analysis to the phase of synthesis.},

	Abstract = {In this model we use the immunodominance concept introduced by
Nowak et al. (1995) for explaining variations in the immune response
induced against virus having mutant epitopes. We propose as source of
free virions, mononuclear peripheral blood cells such as macrophages, in
addition to the currently accepted one, the T-CD4 cells. Our model
suppose healthy and infected reservoirs, virions, T-helper and cytotoxic
cells. Reservoirs are infected by virus, and exhibit viral epitopes.
They are attacked by cytotoxic cells addressed against those epitopes
seen by the immune system. We also propose extracellular T-helper cell
coordinated attack against free virions. We begin studying just one
viral variant, and after making some approximations, we find a stability
criterion that allows differentiating control from viral outgrowth. When
analyzing the system without any approximation, we find no analytical
solution, but numerical simulations show that (a) the precedent
criterion is, however, useful, in determining the system evolution, and
(b) cytotoxic cell attack against reservoirs is a powerful resource in
viral control. We then generalize our model to situations with N
epitopes, each one with M viral variants (for simulations N=M=2), and we
use a Metropolis-like algorithm for generating viral variants. Viral
mutability and number of viral variants are related to viral
progression. Our results suggest that it is important to include in the
therapy control mechanisms for avoiding viral invasion and proliferation
inside reservoirs. Until this goal is achieved avoiding infection is the
only safe measure against AIDS},

	Abstract = {This paper delineates a systematic method for determining
"optimal" intravenous drug delivery strategies for patients
having illnesses that primarily evoke a humoral immune response and are
treatable by antibiotics. The method derives from a nonlinear,
distributed predator-prey model that captures the dominant antigen and
antibody interaction. This model is developed from relevant physiology,
past predator-prey-type modeling work, available data, and pertinent
parameter identification. Embedding this predator-prey model into a
larger class of uncertain systems, by a finite dimensional approximation
and a transformation to a linear fractional representation, enables the
application of robust control based on linear matrix inequality
optimization techniques. The optimization problem is solved by
minimizing an upper bound on a measure of the total drug delivered
subject to patient recovery (stability to healthy equilibrium state).
Specifically, the paper addresses the treatment of Haemophilus
influenzae through modeling, controller development, and simulations of
infected adult patients subjected to typical and proposed intravenous
antibiotic treatments. Through simulations the proposed intravenous drug
strategy shortens patient recovery time, lowers peak drug concentrations
and decreases the total drug administered when compared to standard
antibiotic strategies},

	Abstract = {The immune system protects our organisms against pathogens and aberrant cells. It achieves this capability by processing and evaluating a wide variety of molecular signals many of which are generated by its own agents. Even though the amount of experimental data describing single cellular mechanisms is rapidly growing a satisfactory understanding of the immune system's operations remains very difficult due to the complexity of the system. Simmune, a novel computer program, allows to investigate cellular cooperation within the immune system through simulations on the level of interactions between individual cells. Such simulations may allow to bridge the scale gap between experimentally accessible low level data and higher level multicellular processes which determine the appropriate response to pathogen challenges.},

It is based on specific immune response of the biological immune system which is the cell-mediated immune response. It is also applied for the autonomous guided vehicle (AGV) system which is manufactured in this paper. The AGV is used for the port automation to carry container manlessly and get uncertainty and nonlinearity because of running in the outdoor. To verify performance of the proposed CMIA controller, some experiments for the control of steering of that AGV are performed. Finally, the experimental results for the control of steering and speed of AGV system illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme. These results for the proposed method also show that it has better performance than other conventional controller design methods.},

optimization algorithm inspired by biological immune cell-cooperation,
and this algorithm solves the division-of-labor problems in a
multi-agent system (MAS). The proposed algorithm solves the problem
through interactions between agents, and between agents and the
environment. The interactions are performed by division-and-integration
processing, inspired by immune cell-cooperation and a similar
co-evolutionary approach. The division-and-integration processing
optimizes the work domain, and the similar co-evolutionary approach
performs equal divisions. To investigate the validity, this algorithm is
applied to "N-th agent's Travelling Salesmen Problem" as a typical
problem of MAS. The best property for solving via MAS is clarified with
some simulations},

	Abstract = {Vaccination protocols designed to elicit anti-cancer immune responses have, in most cases, failed in producing tumor eradication and in prolonging patient survival. Usually in cancer vaccination, epitopes from one organism are included in the genome or linked with some protein of another (named carrier) in the hope that the immunogenic properties of the latter will boost an immune response to the former. However, recent results have demonstrated that injections of two different vectors encoding the same recombinant antigen generate high levels of specific immunity. Systematic comparison of the efficacy of different vaccination protocols has been hampered by technical limitations and a clear evidence that the use of multiple vectors has advantage over single carrier injections is lacking. We used a computational model to investigate the dynamics of the immune response to different anti-cancer vaccines based on randomly generated antigen/carrier compounds. More than 3000 simulations of the immune response to tumor were performed. Notably, the model has been extensively validated and it reproduces a relevant number of experimental observations. The model shows that when priming and boosting with the same construct, competition rather than cooperation develops amongst T cell clones of different specificities. Moreover, from the simulations, it appears that the sequential use of multiple carriers may generate more robust anti-tumor immune responses and may lead to effective tumor eradication in a higher percentage of cases. Our results provide a rational background for the design of novel strategies for the achievement of immune control of cancer.},

	Abstract = {This article builds a sort of immune system model basing on cellular automata method, in order to simulate the immune response to tumor growth. This paper discusses immune-tumor system at the cellular level, based on the simple two-dimensional stochastic discrete cellular automaton model. In this simple three-layer structure designers take into account the features of the immune response, and regard many different kinds of immune cells as the single immune element. The model describes the interaction between cancer and immune cells, and shows immune cells growth around tumor. The authors study the normal cellular automaton model, and design the evolution growth rules. At last we build discrete cellular automaton model of tumor-immune system, and simulate tumor-immune system on computer. The model predicts the dynamics of the tumor-immune system in agreement with Gompertz growth. Via adjusting different parameters of simulating model, the ultimate results indicate the basal behaviors of tumor-immune system exactly.},

	Abstract = {When a foreign substance (antigen) is introduced into our bodies, our immune system acts to eliminate that substance. This response is a complex process involving the collective and coordinated response of approximately 1012 cells, which is comparable to the number of synapses in the human brain. In an effort to fit detailed experimental observations into a comprehensive model of the immune system, computer simulations are just beginning to play a role. The approach that we describe uses a modified cellular automaton (or lattice gas). Although our automaton is much more complex than the automata usually considered by mathematicians and is not subject to analytical analysis by presently known methods, it has several advantages over traditional ODE models},

The second uses O(N'2) processors (N' is the number of points) and the third one uses O(N'2) processors (it need the convex hull) to solve the smallest enclosing rectangle problem.

An agent in such domains often needs to learn or evolve to adjust its behaviors, or negotiate with other agents, and so on. Immune cells are the key components of the human immune system, their evolutions in the whole lifecycle directly decide the immune systems performance. In this paper, a model of immune evolution multi-agent system (IEMAS) is introduced based on immune cells evolution principles. In such a system agents can evolve to adapt to the complex, dynamic and uncertain environment. Also, the formal model of IEMAS is described, and then the mature immune cell evolution algorithm and the memory immune cell evolution algorithm of IEMAS are presented. Finally, the run of IEMAS applied to the task allocation in multi-agent systems are presented and displays the efficiency of IEMAS in the complex, dynamic and uncertain environment.},

	Abstract = {We present four polylog-time parallel algorithms for matching parentheses on anexclusive-read and exclusive-write (EREW) parallel random-access machine (PRAM)model. These algorithms provide new insights into the parentheses-matching problem.The first algorithm has a time complexity of O(log/sup 2/ n) employing O(n/(log n))processors for an input string containing n parentheses. Although this algorithm is notcost-optimal, it is extremely simple to implement. The remaining three algorithms, whichare based on a different approach, achieve O(log n) time complexity in each case, andrepresent successive improvements. The second algorithm requires O(n) processors andworking space, and it is comparable to the first algorithm in its ease of implementation.The third algorithm uses O(n/(log n)) processors and O(n log n) space. Thus, it iscost-optimal, but uses extra space compared to the standard stack-based sequentialalgorithm. The last algorithm reduces the space complexity to O(n) while maintaining thesame processor and time complexities. Compared to other existing time-optimal algorithms for the parentheses-matching problem that either employ extensive pipelining or use linked lists and comparable data structures, and employ sorting or a linked list ranking algorithm as subroutines, the last two algorithms have two distinct advantages. First, these algorithms employ arrays as their basic data structures, and second, they do not use any pipelining, sorting, or linked list ranking algorithms.},

	Abstract = {Currently most reported immune system simulations in literature  involve the use of differential equations, genetic algorithm-based  searching or simple cellular automata models. This limits the  diversity in results obtained and thus provides fewer avenues for  experimenting with behavioral responses of the immune system  entities under exogenous stimulations. Complex adaptive systems  (or CAS) by Holland provide a way of modeling natural systems  with complex aggregation and nonlinear interactions to exhibit  emergent behaviours. The immune system, being a powerful and  flexible information processing system is particularly suited to  being modeled using CAS. This paper describes a Java-based  implementation of a framework for modeling the immune system,  particularly Human Immunodeficiency Virus (or HIV) attack,  using a CAS model. The credibility of the system is established  through comparisons against available viral dynamics data.  We  show that it is feasible to achieve relatively accurate predictions  of viral pathogenesis through agent-based discrete event  simulations, the first steps towards improved automation of  hypothesis verification.},

	Abstract = {The mechanism of gene duplication as the means to acquire new genes with previously nonexistent functions is inherently self limiting in that the function possessed by a new protein, in reality, is but a mere variation of the preexisted theme. As the source of a truly unique protein, I suggest an unused open reading frame of the existing coding sequence. Only those coding sequences that started from oligomeric repeats are likely to retain alternative long open reading frames. Analysis of the published base sequence residing in the pOAD2 plasmid of Flavobacterium Sp. K172 indicated that the 392-amino acid-residue-long bacterial enzyme 6-aminohexanoic acid linear oligomer hydrolase involved in degradation of nylon oligomers is specified by an alternative open reading frame of the preexisted coding sequence that originally specified a 472-residue-long arginine-rich protein.},

We propose and demonstrate in extensive simulations a methodology that allows us to answer such questions in setups where good predictors of performance in a task T are available. These predictors evaluate the performance of an agent kind A in a task T*, which can then transformed by including costs and additional factors to make predictions about the performance of A in T.},

	Abstract = {The existing Grid workflow scheduling projects do not handle recursive loops which are characteristic to many scientific problems. We propose a hybrid approach for scheduling Directed Graph (DG)-based workflows in a Grid environment with dynamically changing computational and network resources. Our dynamic scheduling algorithm is based on the iterative invocation of classical static Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) scheduling heuristics generated using well-defined cycle elimination and task migration techniques. We approach the static scheduling problem as an application of a modular optimisation tool using genetic algorithms. We report successful implementation and experimental results on a pilot real-world material science workflow application.},

	Abstract = {Models, architectures and languages for parallel computation have been of utmost research interest in computer science and engineering for several decades. A great variety of parallel computation models has been proposed and studied, and different parallel and distributed architectures designed as some possible ways of harnessing parallelism and improving performance of the general purpose computers.Massively parallel connectionist models such as artificial neural networks (ANNs) and cellular automata (CA) have been primarily studied in domain-specific contexts, namely, learning and complex dynamics, respectively. However, they can also be viewed as generic abstract models of massively parallel computers that are in many respects fundamentally different from the "main stream" parallel and distributed computation models.We compare and contrast herewith the parallel computers as they have been built by the engineers with those built by Nature. We subsequently venture onto a high-level discussion of the properties and potential advantages of the proposed massively parallel computers of the future that would be based on the fine-grained connectionist parallel models, rather than on either various multiprocessor architectures, or networked distributed systems, which are the two main architecture paradigms in building parallel computers of the late 20th and early 21st centuries. The comparisons and contrasts herein are focusing on the fundamental conceptual characteristics of various models rather than any particular engineering idiosyncrasies, and are carried out at both structural and functional levels. The fundamental distinctions between the fine-grain connectionist parallel models and their "classical" coarse-grain counterparts are discussed, and some important expected advantages of the hypothetical massively parallel computers based on the connectionist paradigms conjectured.We conclude with some brief remarks on the role that the paradigms, concepts, and design ideas originating from the connectionist models have already had in the existing parallel design, and what further role the connectionist models may have in the foreseeable future of parallel and distributed computing.},

The author argues that an analogous bridge between software and hardware in required for parallel computation if that is to become as widely used. This article introduces the bulk-synchronous parallel (BSP) model as a candidate for this role, and gives results quantifying its efficiency both in implementing high-level language features and algorithms, as well as in being implemented in hardware.},

The  measure  of efficiency  we  use is in  terms  of the  internal  computation  time  of the  pro-  cessors  and  the  number  of  communication  rounds  needed  to  solve  the  problem  at  hand.  We  present  techniques  that  achieve  optimal  efficiency  in  these  bounds  over  all  possible  values  for  p,  and  we  call  such  techniques  fully-scalable  for  this  reason.  In  particular,  we  address  two  fundamental  problems:  multi-searching  and  convex  hull  construction.  Our  methods  result  in  algorithms  that  use  internal  time  that  is  O(nlogn/p)  and,  for  h =  Q(n/p),  a  number  of  communication  rounds  that  is 0(logn/log(h+1)),  with  high  probability.  Both  of these  bounds  are  asymptotically  optimal  for  the  BSP  model.  },

Updates take O(log1+&egr;n) amori tzed time and queries take O (log n time each, where n is the maximum size of P and &egr; is any fixed positive constant. For some advanced queries such as bridge-finding, both our bounds increase to O(log3/2n). The only previous fully dynamic solution was by Overmars and van Leeuwen from 1981 and required O(log2n) time per update and O(log n) time per query.},

	Abstract = {Research in collective robotics is motivated mainly by the possibility of achieving an efficient solution to multi-objective navigation tasks when multiple robots are employed, instead of a single robot. Several approaches have already been tried in multi-robot systems, but the bio-inspired ones are the most frequent. This paper proposes to augment an autonomous navigation system based on learning classifier systems for using in collective robotics, introducing an inter-robot communication mechanism inspired by ant stigmergy, with each robot acting independently and cooperatively. The navigation system has no innate basic behavior and all knowledge necessary to compose the decision-making artifact is evolved as a function of the environmental feedback only, during navigation. Repulsive and/or attractive pheromone trails are produced by the robots along navigation, following very simple rules. Basically, each robot has to perform obstacle avoidance and target search, and the status of the pheromone level at the position currently occupied by each robot will influence the coordination of the two fundamental behaviors. Experiments are performed in simulation, with comparative results indicating that the presence of the pheromone trails is responsible for significant improvements in the capture rate and in the length of the route adopted by each robot.},

design. The methodology is general, in that it is applicable to a
wide range of multi-agent systems, and comprehensive, in that it
deals with both the macro-level (societal) and the micro-level
(agent) aspects of systems. The methodology is founded on the view of
a system as a computational organisation consisting of various
interacting roles. We illustrate the methodology through a case study
(an agent-based business process management system).},

	Abstract = {One of the well-studied issues in multi-agent systems is the standard action-selection and sequencing problem where a goal task can be performed in different ways, by different agents. Tasks have constraints while agents have different characteristics such as capacity, access to resources, motivations, etc. This class of problems has been tackled under different approaches. Moreover, in open, dynamic environments, agents must be able to adapt to the changing organizational goals, available resources, their relationships to another agents, and so on. This problem is a key one in multi-agent systems and relates to models of learning and adaptation, such as those observed among social insects. The present paper tackles the process of generating, adapting, and changing multiagent organization dynamically at systemruntime, using a swarm inspired approach. This approach is used here mainly for task allocation with low need of pre-planning and specification, and no need of explicit coordination. The results of our approach and another quantitative one are compared here and it is shown that in dynamic domains, the agents adapt to changes in the organization, just as social insects do. },

	Abstract = {The use of handheld networked devices to access information systems by people moving around is spreading rapidly. Systems being used in this way typically face dynamic variation in their operating environment. In order to maintain the usability and usefulness for mobile users, self-adapting systems are needed. Self-adaptation has so far typically been applied only to mission critical systems at considerable additional cost. However, we now need ways to implement such capabilities that are affordable also in everyday systems development.In this paper we propose an approach to building such self-adapting systems where the adaptation is handled by generic middleware. The proposed approach builds on component frameworks and variability engineering to achieve adaptable systems, and property modelling, architectural reflection and context monitoring to support dynamic self-adaptation. We define a set of requirements for affordable self-adaptation and discuss the proposed approach in relation to these requirements.},

	Abstract = {Traditional mechanisms that allow a system to detect and recover from errors are typically wired into applications at the level of code where they are hard to change, reuse, or analyze. An alternative approach is to use externalized adaptation: one or more models of a system are maintained at run time and external to the application as a basis for identifying problems and resolving them. In this paper we provide an overview of recent research in which we use architectural models as the basis for such problem diagnosis and repair. These models can be specialized to the particular style of the system, the quality of interest, and the dimensions of run time adaptation that are permitted by the running system.},

	Abstract = {In the last few years, the advance of multimedia applications has  prompted researchers to undertake the task of routing multimedia  data through Manet. This task is rather difficult due to the highly  dynamic topology of mobile ad hoc networks and their limited  bandwidth. Actually, different routing algorithms are proposed in  order to route various kinds of sources (such as voice, video, or  data) with diverse traffic characteristics and Quality of Service  Requirements (QoS). These algorithms must take into account   significant traffic problems such as packet losses, transmission  delays, delay variations, etc, caused mainly by congestion in the  networks. The prediction of these problems in real time is quite  difficult, making the effectiveness of ``traditional'' protocols based  on analytical models questionable. We propose in this paper a  solution based on swarm intelligence paradigm that we find more  adapted for this kind of problems. },

	Abstract = {Swarm behavior as demonstrated by flocks of birds, schools of fish, and swarms of insects provide a useful method for implementing a distributed network of mobile sensor platforms. Such mobile sensor swarm systems are useful for various search or surveillance activities.  Swarm behavior ensures safe separation between swarm members while enforcing a  level of cohesion. These two properties, when considered in  the context of sensors and wireless communications, provide for low redundancy coverage and a robust and reliable communications system. This paper examines particle swarm  behavior through simulation with respect to such a sensor network. Analysis of swarm behavior for various parameter settings indicate a classification methodology. This provides a foundation for a proposed taxonomy.},

	Abstract = {Natural forming multi-agent systems (aka Swarms) have the ability to grow to enormous sizes without requiring any of the agents to oversee the entire system. The success of these systems comes from the fact that agents are simple and the interaction with the environment and neighboring agents is local in nature. In this paper we look at abstractions in the field of swarms and study their applicability in the context of coordination systems. In particular, we focus on the problematic issue of scalability of Linda systems.},

The extensions are tested by simulating the evolution of a colony of virtual ants (vants). In this simulation, each vant is modelled as an agent and is assigned a set of genes that control some aspects of its behaviour, such as its velocity, memory, communication abilities, scepticism, etc. Some emergent properties of the swarm of vants have been observed.},

@article{backus-1998,
	Abstract = {Before 1954 almost all programming was done in machine language or assembly language. Programmers rightly regarded their work as a complex, creative art that required human inventiveness to produce an efficient program. Much of their effort was devoted to overcoming the difficulties created by the computers of that era: the lack of index registers, the lack of built- in floating point operations, restricted instruction sets (which might have AND but not OR, for example), and primitive input- output arrangements. Given the nature of computers, the services which ``automatic programming'' performed for the programmer were concerned with overcoming the machine's shortcomings. Thus the primary concern of some ``automatic programming'' systems was to allow the use of symbolic addresses and decimal numbers (e.g., the MIDAC Input Translation Program [Brown and Carr 1954]). But most of the larger ``automatic. Programming'' systems (with the exception of Laning and Zierler's algebraic system [Laning and Zierler 1954] and the A-2 compiler [Remington Rand 1953; Moser 1954]) simply provided a synthetic ``computer'' with an order code different from that of the real machine. This synthetic computer usually had floating point instructions and index registers and had improved input-output commands; it was therefore much easier to program than its real counterpart.},
