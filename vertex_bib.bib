	Abstract = {A key problem in Wireless Sensor Networks is that of scheduling sensors into sleep-sense cycles that maximize the lifetime of the network while ensuring coverage of a set of targets. This is a known NP-complete problem, due to the exponential number of possible ways to select a subset of sensors to turn on. Our earlier work had presented a unique model for this problem by introducing a lifetime dependency (LD) graph in which these possible cover sets are nodes and edges represent shared sensors between them. Using the graph properties, we presented a range of effective distributed heuristics. Even though the local subgraphs are practically tractable, their theoretically exponential growth has remained a persistent issue. In this paper, we present a theoretical model for representing this exponential space of possible cover sets that groups related covers together, thereby reducing this exponential space virtually to a linear one. We then present an equivalence class (EC) graph as a model for this reduction. We use these underlying theoretical properties to develop a smart linear time sampling algorithm of this exponential space. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our sampling technique, we employ the sampled localized LD subgraph as input to our previous heuristics. Simulation studies show about twofold speedup while reducing solution quality (network lifetime) only by under 10% when compared to our previous heuristics that operate on the exponential space. We also compare our algorithms to two other state-of-art greedy algorithms and show that ours still manage to achieve improvements of around 8-10% over them.},

	Abstract = {Whether local algorithms can compute constant approximations of NP-hard problems is of both practical and theoretical interest. So far, no algorithms achieving this goal are known, as either the approximation ratio or the running time exceed O(1), or the nodes are provided with non-trivial additional information. In this paper, we present the first distributed algorithm approximating a minimum dominating set on a planar graph within a constant factor in constant time. Moreover, the nodes do not need any additional information.},
	Address = {New York, NY, USA},
	Annote = {Lenzen, Oswald, and Wattenhofer present a local algorithm that solves the Minimum Dominating Set problem on planar graphs. The Approximation ratio given for the algorithm is 74. However, no other constant local approximation of this problem for planar graphs had been found at the time of publication.

The proof of correctness and locality is quite rigorous and makes up the bulk of the paper. The algorithm as presented is linear but is trivially distributable. Essentially, each node elects a neighbor to join the DS, then if some node has more than a constant number of neighbors in the DS, it joins the DS and tells its neighbors to leave the set. These steps are repeated once, and then any uncovered nodes choose a neighbor to join the set.

Open questions are whether this algorithm could be improved upon in planar graphs or modified for another class of graphs. Some limitations on local approximation are discussed.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we consider the connected target coverage (CTC) problem with the objective of maximizing the network lifetime by scheduling sensors into multiple sets, each of which can maintain both target coverage and connectivity among all the active sensors and the sink.We model the CTC problem as a maximum cover tree (MCT) problem and prove that the MCT problem is NP-Complete. We determine an upper bound on the network lifetime for the MCT problem and then develop a (1+w) H (M) approximation algorithm to solve it, where is an arbitrarily small number, H(M) = Σ1≤i≤M (1/i) and M is the maximum number of targets in the sensing area of any sensor. As the protocol cost of the approximation algorithm may be high in practice, we develop a faster heuristic algorithm based on the approximation algorithm called Communication Weighted Greedy Cover (CWGC) algorithm and present a distributed implementation of the heuristic algorithm. We study the performance of the approximation algorithm and CWGC algorithm by comparing them with the lifetime upper bound and other basic algorithms that consider the coverage and connectivity problems independently. Simulation results show that the approximation algorithm and CWGC algorithm perform much better than others in terms of the network lifetime and the performance improvement can be up to 45% than the best-known basic algorithm. The lifetime obtained by our algorithms is close to the upper bound. Compared with the approximation algorithm, the CWGC algorithm can achieve a similar performance in terms of the network lifetime with a lower protocol cost.},

	Abstract = {The wireless sensor network "macroscope" offers the potential to advance science by enabling dense temporal and spatial monitoring of large physical volumes. This paper presents a case study of a wireless sensor network that recorded 44 days in the life of a 70-meter tall redwood tree, at a density of every 5 minutes in time and every 2 meters in space. Each node measured air temperature, relative humidity, and photosynthetically active solar radiation. The network captured a detailed picture of the complex spatial variation and temporal dynamics of the microclimate surrounding a coastal redwood tree. This paper describes the deployed network and then employs a multi-dimensional analysis methodology to reveal trends and gradients in this large and previously-unobtainable dataset. An analysis of system performance data is then performed, suggesting lessons for future deployments.},

	Abstract = {We introduce a medium access control protocol for ad hoc networks. The new protocol, which we call ORMA (opportunistic reservation multiple access) is aimed at providing both high throughput and bounded channel access delays, which are critical for supporting integrated voice and data services over ad hoc networks. In ORMA, the channel is divided into a random access section and a scheduled access section. The first is used to exchange neighborhood information, the latter is used for data transmissions over time slots organized in frames, with each time slot being accessed through reservations or probabilistic elections. To attain high throughput, nodes access data slots based on a fair election in which they win with a certain probability. To attain bounded channel access delays, nodes reserve time slots by using a novel opportunistic reservation. The performance of ORMA is studied by both analysis and simulations. It is also compared against the performance of schemes based entirely on probabilistic or fixed conflict-free slot assignment},

	Abstract = {We present a new set of distributed algorithms for scheduling sensors to enhance the total lifetime of a wireless sensor network. These algorithms are based on constructing minimal cover sets each consisting of one or more sensors which can collectively cover the local targets.  Some of the covers are heuristically better than others for a sensor trying to decide its own sense-sleep status.  This leads to various ways to assign priorities to the covers. The algorithms work by having each sensor transition through these possible prioritized cover sets, settling for the best cover it can negotiate with its neighbors.   A local lifetime dependency graph consisting of the cover sets as nodes with any two nodes connected if the corresponding covers intersect captures the interdependencies among the covers. We present several variations of the basic algorithmic framework.  The priority function of a cover is derived from its degree or connectedness in the dependency graph - usually lower the better.  Lifetime improvement is 10% to 20% over the existing algorithms, while maintaining comparable communication overheads.   We also show how previous algorithms can be formulated within our framework. },

	Abstract = {We consider the problem of efficient MAC design for long-distance WiFi-based mesh networks. In such networks it is common to find long propagation delays, the use of directional antennas, and the presence of inter-link interference. Prior work has shown that these characteristics make traditional CSMA-based MACs a poor choice for long-distance mesh networks and this finding has led to several recent research efforts exploring the use of TDMA-based approaches to media access. In this paper we first identify, and then address, several shortcomings of current TDMA-based proposals. First, because they use fixed-length transmission slots, current TDMA-based solutions do not adapt to dynamic variations in traffic load leading to inefficiencies in both throughput and delay. As we show in this paper, the throughput achieved by existing solutions falls far short of the optimal achievable network throughput. Finally, due to the scheduling constraints imposed by inter-link interference, current TDMA-based solutions only apply to bipartite network topologies.

In this paper, we present JazzyMac, a simple, practical and efficient MAC protocol that addresses the above limitations. JazzyMac achieves efficiency by allowing variable-length link transmissions slots and then defining a distributed protocol by which nodes adapt the length of their transmission slots to changing traffic demands. JazzyMac is practical in that the adaptation at each node uses purely local information and that our protocol applies to arbitrary network topologies. Finally, the use of dynamic slot sizes allows JazzyMac to achieve better tradeoffs between throughput and delay.

We evaluate JazzyMac using detailed simulation over a range of traffic patterns and realistic topologies. Our results show that JazzyMac improves throughput in all considered scenarios. This improvement is often substantial (e.g.,in 50% of our scenarios, throughput improves by over 40%) and is particularly pronounced for the common case of asymmetric traffic (e.g.,leading to almost 100% improvements). Furthermore, compared to current solutions, JazzyMac can achieve much better average delay for the same throughput.},

	Abstract = { We survey approximation algorithms for some well-known and very natural combinatorial optimization problems, the minimum set covering, the minimum vertex covering, the maximum set packing, and maximum independent set problems; we discuss their approximation performance and their complexity. For already known results, any time we have conceived simpler proofs than those already published, we give these proofs, and, for the rest, we cite the simpler published ones. Finally, we discuss how one can relate the approximability behavior (from both a positive and a negative point of view) of vertex covering to the approximability behavior of a restricted class of independent set problems.  },

	Abstract = { We investigate the fixed-parameter complexity of WEIGHTED VERTEX COVER. Given a graph G = (V, E), a weight function ω: V → R+, and k ∈ R+, WEIGHTED VERTEX COVER (WVC for short) asks for a vertex subset C ⊆ V of total weight at most k such that every edge of G has at least one endpoint in C. WVC and its natural variants are NP-complete. We observe that, when restricting the range of ω to positive integers, the so-called INTEGER-WVC can be solved as fast as unweighted VERTEX COVER. Our main result is that if the range of ω is restricted to positive reals ≥ 1, then so-called REAL-WVC can be solved in time O(1.3954k + k|V|). By way of contrast, unless P = NP, the problem is not fixed-parameter tractable if arbitrary weights > 0 are allowed. Using dynamic programming, at the expense of exponential memory use, we can improve the running time of REALWVC to O(1.3788k + k|V|). The same technique applied to a known algorithm yields the so far fastest algorithm for unweighted VERTEX COVER, running in time O(1.2832kk + k|V|). },

	Abstract = { We give time lower bounds for the distributed approximation of minimum vertex cover (MVC) and related problems such as minimum dominating set (MDS). In k communication rounds, MVC and MDS can only be approximated by factors Ω(nc/k2/k) and Ω(Δ>1/k/k) for some constant c, where n and Δ denote the number of nodes and the largest degree in the graph. The number of rounds required in order to achieve a constant or even only a polylogarithmic approximation ratio is at least Ω(√log n/log log n) and Ω(logΔ/ log log Δ). By a simple reduction, the latter lower bounds also hold for the construction of maximal matchings and maximal independent sets. },

	Abstract = { Let G &equals; (V, E) be an undirected graph, with three numbers d0(e) ≥ d1(e) ≥ d2(e) ≥ 0 for each edge e ∈ E. A solution is a subset U ⊆ V and di(e) represents the cost contributed to the solution by the edge e if exactly i of its endpoints are in the solution. The cost of including a vertex v in the solution is c(v). A solution has cost that is equal to the sum of the vertex costs and the edge costs. The minimum generalized vertex cover problem is to compute a minimum cost set of vertices. We study the complexity of the problem with the costs d0(e) &equals; 1, d1(e) &equals; α and d2(e) &equals; 0 ∀e ∈ E and c(v) &equals; β∀v ∈ V, for all possible values of α and β. We also provide 2-approximation algorithms for the general case. },

Specific results include the following.

For WEIGHTED VERTEX COVER, the first distributed 2-approximation algorithm taking O(log n) rounds and the first parallel 2-approximation algorithm in RNC. The algorithms generalize to covering mixed integer linear programs (CMIP) with two variables per constraint (δ = 2).

For any covering problem with monotone constraints and submodular cost, a distributed δ-approximation algorithm taking O(log2 |C|) rounds, where |C| is the number of constraints. (Special cases include CMIP, facility location, and probabilistic (two-stage) variants of these problems.)},

	Abstract = {This paper describes a greedy {\ensuremath{\Delta}}-approximation algorithm for monotone covering, a generalization of many fundamental NP-hard covering problems. The approximation ratio {\ensuremath{\Delta}} is the maximum number of variables on which any constraint depends. (For example, for vertex cover, {\ensuremath{\Delta}} is 2.) The algorithm unifies, generalizes, and improves many previous algorithms for fundamental covering problems such as vertex cover, set cover, facilities location, and integer and mixed-integer covering linear programs with upper bound on the variables.

The algorithm is also the first {\ensuremath{\Delta}}-competitive algorithm for online monotone covering, which generalizes online versions of the above-mentioned covering problems as well as many fundamental online paging and caching problems. As such it also generalizes many classical online algorithms, including lru, fifo, fwf, balance, greedy-dual, greedy-dual size (a.k.a. landlord), and algorithms for connection caching, where {\ensuremath{\Delta}} is the cache size. It also gives new {\ensuremath{\Delta}}-competitive algorithms for upgradable variants of these problems, which model choosing the caching strategy and an appropriate hardware configuration (cache size, CPU, bus, network, etc.).},
